<p class="pch">THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL</p>


<p class="drop-cap04">“HUSH! Stop it, Davy. He’s a-comin’!”</p>

<p class="pn">The old woman who spoke&mdash;a wrinkled
dame she was, bowed down by years and
infirmity, her face creased by a thousand grimed-in,
wrinkled lines&mdash;moved with an odd sprightliness as
she stepped across the floor. She placed a hand upon
the shoulder of the young man whom she accosted,
standing between him and the door of the little cabin
of which they were the only occupants.</p>

<p>The young man turned toward her, smiling half
dreamily. He was a tall man, as his outstretched legs,
one crossed over the other, would attest; a man well
developed, muscular and powerful. His gray eyes
seemed now half a-dream, his wide mouth fixed itself
in pleasant lines, so that he seemed far away, somewhere
in the lands to which music offers access. For
now he had been engaged in the production of what
perhaps might have been called music. It was an old
ballad tune he had been playing on his violin, and but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
now his grandam had joined in high and cracking
treble on the old air of “Barbara Allen,” known time
out of mind in these hills. It was the keener ear
of the old woman which first had caught warning of
approaching danger.</p>

<p>“Take keer, I say!” she repeated, and shook him
impatiently. “I tell ye I heerd him come in at the
lower gate. He’ll be here direckly. Git shet of that
fiddle, boy!”</p>

<p>She bent on him a pair of deep-set hazel eyes, sharp
as those of some wild creature. Her voice had in it
a half-masculine dominance. Every movement of her
stooped and broken body bespoke a creature full of
resolution, fearless, fierce.</p>

<p>“Gawd knows why he’s back so soon,” she went on,
“but he’s here. Give him time to turn old Molly loose
and git a few years of corn, an’ he’ll be right in.
Onct he hears that fiddle he’ll raise trouble, that’s
what he’ll do. I reckon I know a preacher, an’ most
of all yore daddy. For him thar hain’t nothin’ sinfuller’n
a fiddle; he’s pizen on ’em&mdash;all preachers is&mdash;him
wust of all. What does he know about music?
Now, if he was French an’ Irish, like me, it mought
be different. But then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I kain’t hep it, Granny,” said the young man, still
slowly, still unchanged, his fingers still trailing across
the strings. “‘Barbara Allen’&mdash;do ye call that wicked,
even on a Sunday? Besides, this is the fust time I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
ever strung this fiddle up full. I couldn’t git the
strings till jest now. Melissa says&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never mind what Meliss’ says neither&mdash;she’s a
triflin’ sort, even if she is yore own wife. For all
that, ye’d orter be home this minute, like enough.”</p>

<p>“As if ye understood!” said the young man, sighing
now and dropping the instrument to his knee. For
the first time a shade of sadness crossed his face, giving
to his features a certain sternness and masculine
vigor.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I understand, Davy? Listen&mdash;ye
hain’t for these hills. Ye’re a throw-back somehow,
ye don’t belong here. I say that, though yore daddy
is my own son. Don’t I know him&mdash;he’d skin us
alive if he found us two here fiddlin’ on Sunday
atternoon. He certainly would shake us out over hell
fire, boy! When he gits started to exhortin’ and
damnin’ around here, he certainly is servigerous. Ye
know that. Hist, now!”</p>

<p>The young man himself now heard the sound of
heavy footsteps slopping on the sodden earth, the slam
of the slat gate’s wooden latch as someone entered.
There followed the stamp of heavy feet on the broken
gallery, where evidently someone was stopping for an
instant to kick off the mud.</p>

<p>Before the newcomer could enter the young man
arose, and with one stride gained the opening that
led up to the loose-floored loft of the single-storied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
log house. He reached up a long arm and laid the
offending fiddle back out of sight upon the floor.</p>

<p>Just as he turned there entered the person against
whose advent he had been warned&mdash;a tall man, large
of frame, bushy and gray-white of hair and as to a
beard whose strong, close-set growth gave him a look
of singular fierceness. As he stood he might have
seemed fifty years old. In reality he was past seventy.
The young man who faced him now&mdash;his son&mdash;was
twenty-eight. A stalwart breed this, housed here in
this cabin in a cove of the ancient Cumberlands. The
old dame who stood now, her eyes turning from one
to the other, would never see her ninetieth birthday
again.</p>

<p>Andrew Joslin, commonly known through these
half-dozen mountain communities where he rode circuit
as “Preacher Joslin,” stood now in the door of
his own home and looked about him with his accustomed
sternness&mdash;a sternness always more intense
upon the Lord’s Day. A somber, dour nature, that
of this mountain minister, whose main mission in life
was to proclaim the wrath of God. A man of yea,
yea, and nay, nay, one must have said who saw him
standing now, his gray eyes looking out fiercely,
searchingly, beneath his bushy brows.</p>

<p>“What ye been doin’?” he asked suspiciously now,
indifferently of the old woman, his mother, and the
stalwart young man, his own son. “What ye doin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
here, David? Why hain’t ye home? Why hain’t
ye at church to-day, like ye’d orter be?”</p>

<p>“Thar’s no sarvices nowhars near here, an’ ye
know it, Andrew,” said the old woman somewhat
querulously.</p>

<p>“Thar kin be sarvices anywhar whar a few is gethered
together in the name of the Lord. Ye two right
here could hold sarvices for the glory of God, if so
as ye wanted to.”</p>

<p>Neither made answer to him, and he went on:</p>

<p>“David, have ye read all of that thar book I give
ye? Ye’d orter git some good outen Calvin’s Institutes.
Ye’ll maybe be a preacher some time like yore
daddy.”</p>

<p>“Well, daddy, I done tried to read her. I set up all
one night with Preacher Cuthbertson from over in
Owsley, an’ we both read sever’l chapters in them
Institutes. Hit was nigh about midnight when we
both went to sleep, an’ atter I’d went to sleep he done
shuk me by the shoulder an’ woke me up, an’ he says
to me, ‘David, David, I’ve been thinkin’ over them
Institutes so hard.... I believe they’ve injured my
mind’!”</p>

<p>The young man broke into a wide-mouthed smile as
he made this recountal. But it was a thundercloud
of wrath upon the face of his father which greeted
such levity.</p>

<p>“Ye wasn’t reverent!” he blazed. “Ye was impyous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
both of ye. Injure his mind&mdash;why, that feller
Cuthbertson never had no mind fer to injure. That’s
what ails him. The book of John Calvin is one of the
greatest books in the world. What’ll folks like ye
and Preacher Cuthbertson be up an’ sayin’ next? An’
I’d set ye apart for the ministry, too, allowin’ I could
git ye some schoolin’ atter a while, somewhars.”</p>

<p>He turned from them both, and stood a little apart,
his brows drawn down into a scowling frown.</p>

<p>“How come ye come home so soon, Andrew?”
asked his mother now. “We wasn’t expectin’ ye
back&mdash;ye told me ye was a-goin’ over to Leslie to
preach a couple days on the head of Hell-fer-Sartin.
But ye only left yisterday.”</p>

<p>“Hit’s none yore business how I got back so soon,”
replied the old man savagely. “I don’t have to account
to no one what I do.”</p>

<p>He turned about now moodily. In his great hand
he still clutched the heavy umbrella which he carried,
its whalebone ribs and cotton cover dripping rivulets.
A step or two brought him to the opening in the loft
floor, where he reached up to place the wet umbrella
out of the way. As he did so his hand struck some
other object hidden there. He grasped it and drew
it down&mdash;and stood, his face fairly contorted with
surprise and anger.</p>

<p>It was his son’s violin which now he clutched in his
gnarled and bony hand. As he regarded it the emotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
on his face was as much that of horror as aught else.
A violin, an instrument of hell, here in his house&mdash;his
house&mdash;a chosen minister of God!</p>

<p>“What’s this?” he demanded at length. “Tell me&mdash;how
come this thing here&mdash;in my house!”</p>

<p>With one stride now&mdash;tearing away all the strings
of the instrument with one grasp of his hand as he
did so&mdash;he flung the offending violin full upon the
flames in the fireplace, sweeping from him with an
outward thrust of his great arm the tall figure of his
son, who impulsively stepped forward to save his
cherished instrument. As for the wrinkled old woman,
she stood arrested in an attitude as near approaching
fear as any she ever had evinced. She knew the fierce
temper of both these men.</p>

<p>But the young man, the equal in height of his parent,
his superior in strength, stayed his own impulse
and lowered the clenched hand he had raised. Filial
obedience, after all, was strong in his heart</p>

<p>“That’s whar it belongs!” exclaimed the older man,
his eyes flashing. “In hell fire is whar all them things
belongs, an’ the critters that fosters ‘em. My own
flesh an’ blood! O Lord God, lay not up this against
thy sarvent!”</p>

<p>“Ye have sinned against the Lord,” he began, excited
now in something of the religious fervor which
had had no expenditure of late. He thrust a long,
bony finger towards his son. “Ye an’ yore granny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
both have sinned. To Adam was give the grace of
perseverin’ in good if he choosed. Adam had the
power if he had the will, but not the will that he
mought have the power. It was give to all of us subserquents
to have both the will an’ the power fer to
obstain from sin. But have ye two obstained? Look
at that thing a-quoilin’ up in hell. That’s what comes
to them that fosters evil when they have both the will
an’ the power, an’ don’t use neither.”</p>

<p>They stood looking at him silently, and he went on,
still more excited.</p>

<p>“Ye have-ah&mdash;tempted of the Lord,” he intoned.
“Ye have forgot the holy commandments of the Lord-ah!
Ye have sinned in the sight of God on the holy
Sabbath day-ah! Ye have kivered up yore sin from
me, the sarvent of the Lord-ah! Ye have plotted agin
me. Ye have no grace, fer grace is not offered by
the Lord to be either received or rejected&mdash;it is grace
that perjuces both the will an’ the choice in the heart
of man. But whar air the subserquent good works of
grace? Ye don’t show them. Ye nuvver had no
grace, neither one of ye! The both of ye will quoil
in hell like that thing thar.”</p>

<p>“Tell me”&mdash;he turned now to the old dame&mdash;“was
he a-fiddlin’ here in my house on the Lord’s
day?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he war, an’ it hain’t the first time!” exclaimed
the old woman. “I don’t keer who knows it. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
war a-playin’ ‘Barbara Allen’ here, an’ I war a-singin’
to it. Now ye know it, an’ what air ye goin’ to do
about it?”</p>

<p>For a moment the three stood in tableau, strong,
yet sad enough. Then the fierce soul of the old man
flamed yet more.</p>

<p>“Disgrace me&mdash;in my own house! Out of my house,
ye, an’ never darken its doors agin! Yore wife and
children need ye plenty ‘thout ye comin’ up here,
fiddlin’ in a preacher’s house on Sunday.”</p>

<p>“Do ye mean that, daddy?” asked the young man
quietly. “Do ye reelly mean that? Maybe ye’d
better think it over.”</p>

<p>“I don’t have to think it over,” retorted the other.
“Begone! Don’t nuvver come here again.”</p>

<p>“I reckon I’ll go too,” said the grandam, reaching
out a skinny arm for the sunbonnet on its peg at the
door.</p>

<p>“Ye’ll do nothin’ of the sort,” replied her son
savagely. “Ye belong here. Let him go. I sont his
mother outen the same door onct.”</p>

<p>“I know ye did, Andrew,” she replied, her fierce
eyes untamed as she faced him. “An’ as good a womern
as ever was in the world when she started, ontel ye
cowed her an’ abused her, an’ sont her down the river&mdash;ye
know whar, an’ ye know into what. Ye kin
preach till ye’re daid, and shake me over hell fire all
ye like, but ye kain’t change me, and ye kain’t scare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
me, an’ ye know it almighty well. I’ll stay here, an’
I’ll go when I git ready, an’ ye know that.”</p>

<p>“Go on, Davy.” She turned to the young man who
stood, gray and silent, his hand upon the half-opened
door. “Take him at his word, an’ don’t ye nuvver
come back here agin. If ye hain’t happy in yore own
home, git outen these mountings&mdash;git somewhars else.
No matter what ye do, ye kain’t do worsen what ye’re
doin’ here. Ye know that yore maw nuvver flickered
afore him&mdash;nor yore granny neither&mdash;an’ don’t ye.”</p>

<p>The gray old man stood silent, at bay, in the center
of the squalid little room&mdash;a room cluttered up with
heavy, homemade chairs, a pair of corded bedsteads, a
low board table; an interior lighted now in the approaching
gloom of evening by nothing better than
the log fire on the deep-worn hearth. It was an old,
old room in an old, old house. The threshold of the
door, renewed no man might say how often, was worn
yet again to the bottom. Its hinges of wood were
again worn half in two. The floor, made of puncheons
once five inches thick, hewn by a hand-adze two generations
ago from some giant poplar tree, now
worn almost as smooth as glass by the polishing of
bare feet&mdash;puncheons more than a yard wide each as
they lay here on the ancient floor beams. A pair of
windows, once owning glass, partially lighted the room,
and there were two doors, one standing ajar at the
farther end of the room making upon a covered passageway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
which led to a second cabin. In this usually
went forward, it might be supposed, the cooking operations
of the place, such as they were.</p>

<p>At length the old woman stepped to the side of the
fireplace and kicked together the ends of the logs.
A faint flame arose, now lighting up the interior of
this half-savage abode. It showed all the better the
tall form of the young man at the door. He spoke
no more. With one last glance straight at the face of
his father, he turned and passed out into the dusk.</p>

<p>The old man, suddenly trembling, now cast himself
into a chair before the fire and sat staring into the
flickering flames.</p>

<p>“Whar’s my supper?” he demanded hoarsely after a
time.</p>

<p>“Thar hain’t none ready, an’ ye know it,” said his
mother. “If I’d a-knowed ye war a-comin’ back I
mought have got something ready. What made ye?”</p>

<p>“Hit war the Lord’s will,” he rejoined. “I’ve met
causes sufficient. The Lord brung me back to find out
what was a-goin’ on here, I reckon. The Sabbath,
too!”</p>

<p>“Hit’s no worse one day than another,” said his
mother. “Ye’ve druv yore own son outen yore own
house. He’s got no house of his own to go to, to speak
of&mdash;God knows thar’s little enough to keep him thar,
that’s shore. Thar’s little enough to keep any of us
here, come to that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Her attitude certainly was not that of shrinking or
fear. Granny Joslin was known far and wide through
these mountains as the fightingest of the fighting Joslins;
and that was saying much.</p>

<p>“Womern, womern!” The old preacher raised a
hand in protest. There was a sort of weakening in
his face and his attitude, a sort of quavering in his
voice.</p>

<p>She turned and looked at him&mdash;looked at the floor
where his chair sat before the fireplace. Beside the
drip of the old umbrella there was another stain spreading
on the floor now&mdash;darker than that which first
had marked it; a stain which seemed to have darkened
his garments and to have caked on his heavy,
homemade shoes.</p>

<p>“What’s that, Andy?” she asked imperiously, but
knowing well enough what it was. “Who done that?”</p>

<p>He made no answer for a time, but at length remarked
with small concern, “Why, old Absalom done
that, that’s who. He knifed me in the back when I
was lookin’ the other way atter his two boys.”</p>

<p>“Ye taken the old hill trail, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it wasn’t so slippy as the creek road up to
Hell-fer-Sartin. Oh, I know I was warned outen thar,
but I couldn’t show the white feather, could I?”</p>

<p>“No, ye couldn’t, not even if ye war a preacher.”
By this time she was busying herself caring for his
wound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, that’s how it come,” went on Andrew Joslin.
“I taken the hill trail turnin’ off yander from the
creek, like ye know. I met them up in the hills. The
Lord led me to ‘em, maybe. The Lord fotched me back
here, too, to find what I have found. How have I
sinned!”</p>

<p>“If ye didn’t kill old Absalom Gannt ye shore have
sinned,” remarked his fierce dam casually. “Was it
some fight they made?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes. Thar wasn’t but me along, exceptin’
Chan Bullock from over on the head of the Buffalo&mdash;we
met up jest as I got up into the hills. When we
turned down the head of Rattlesnake we run acrosst
them people settin’ under a tree, dry, an’ playin’ a
game of keerds, right on the Lord’s day. I rid up
with my pistol in my hand, an’ I says to them I didn’t
think they war a-doin’ right to play keerds thar. I
seen old Absalom thar, an’ two of his boys and two of
his cousins. Before I could say much to them, one of
the boys he up and fired fust. He hit old Molly in
the neck. She pitched some then, an’ afore I could
git her whar I could do anything, the feller that fired
at me, he slipped over down the big bank back of
him, an’ got away in the bush. They had their horses
thar, an’ a couple of ‘em jumped on horseback an’
begun firin’ at me, an’ all the time old Molly was
a-jumpin’ so nobody could hit nobody offen her. Then
come Chan Bullock ridin’ up closeter to me. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
along his old fifty-caliber Winchester&mdash;never could
bear them big guns; they shoot too high. Well, he
fired couple of times, an’ missed, an’ by that time all
of Absalom an’ his folks was on the run, either horseback
er afoot.</p>

<p>“I seen the boy that done shot at me a-runnin’ down
the creek bed more’n a hundred and fifty yard away.
I grabbed the gun away from Chan, an’ I says, ‘If I
couldn’t shoot no better’n ye kin I’d be ashamed o’
myself.’ So I taken a keerful aim&mdash;ye see, I helt
a leetle ahead of him&mdash;an’ when I pulls the trigger he
rolls over about four times atter he hit the ground.
I swear that big rifle must be a hard-hittin’ gun&mdash;hit
war a good two-hundred yard when I shot!</p>

<p>“Chan didn’t have no pistol along, an’ mine had
fell on the ground. While all this war a-happenin’,
Absalom he had snuck back behint the tree whar they
was a-settin’ an’ a-playin’ keerds. Now, when my
back was turned, he run out an’ he cut me two er three
times right here in the back, afore I could hep myself.
Then he run off, too.”</p>

<p>“An’ ye didn’t git ‘im?”</p>

<p>“How could I? He run down the creek bed road
towarge whar that other feller was. I covered him fair
with Chan’s gun&mdash;but she snapped on me. He hadn’t
had but a couple of hulls, an’ I’d shot the last shot at
Pete when I got him. So Absalom, he got away.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see how come me to come home,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
added presently, having faithfully told his kin the full
story of the latest combat. “I didn’t know as I could
git acrosst the mountings into Hell-fer-Sartin an’
preach fer a couple days. Somehow it seemed to me
I had orter come back home. I did&mdash;an’, well
you see what I’ve done found here. I didn’t git
Absalom. I’ve lost my son, David. Hit ’pears to me
like I’m forsaken of the Lord this day!”</p>

<p>His mother made no comment, but stepped up to
the mantel-piece and reached down a bottle of white
liquid, from which she poured half a pint into a gourd
which she found alongside the bottle.</p>

<p>“Drink this,” said she. “We’ll git Absalom some
other time.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="pch">A NEW CREED</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE young man who had been dismissed from
his father’s house walked unmindful of the
rain still falling in the evening gloom, nor
looked back to the door now closed behind him. His
face, strong and deeply lined, now had settled into a
sternness which belied the half-humorous expression
it but now had borne. He was wide of chest, broad
of shoulder, straight of limb as he walked now, hands
in pockets, straightforward, not slouching down, his
back flat. There was little of apathy or weakness about
him, one would have said. Well-clad, such a man as
he would attract many a backward gaze from men&mdash;or
women&mdash;on any city street.</p>

<p>He stepped straight down the little bank beyond
the fence marking the delimitations of the scant yard
and the little cornfield of Preacher Joslin’s cabin, and
at once was in the road, or all the road that ever had
been known there. It was no better than the rocky
bed of the shallow creek which flowed directly in
front of the cabin. Here, in the logging days, iron-shod
wheels had worn deep grooves into the sand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
rock. The longer erosion of the years also had cut
sharp the faces of some of the clay banks. It might
have been seen in a stronger light than this of twilight,
that these banks had great seams of black running
parallel through them&mdash;croppings of the heavy
coal seams known throughout the region.</p>

<p>From time to time the young man sprang from
rock to rock as he made his way down the bed of the
little branch now running full from the heavy rain, but
he walked on carelessly, for the road was well known
to him by day or night. It had been the path of himself,
his family, his ancestors, for well nigh a hundred
years.</p>

<p>As he advanced, David Joslin cast an eye now and
again upon the mountain sides. They were beautiful,
even in the dull of evening, clad in gorgeous autumnal
glories of chlorophyll afire under the combined alchemies
of the rain, the frost, and the sun. There were
reds more brilliant than may be seen even among the
maples of the far north when the frost comes, yellows
for which a new color name must be invented, browns
of unspeakable velvety softness, a thousand ocherous
and saffron hues such as no palette carries. They lay
now softened and dulled, but very beautiful.</p>

<p>Young Joslin knew every hill, every ravine, every
mountain cove which lay about him here,&mdash;all the country
for fifty miles. Presently he reached the end of
this little side trail down from the mountains, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
emerged into a wider valley where passed the considerable
volume of a fork of the Kentucky River, itself
now running yellow from the rains. Had he cared he
might have noted, now passing on the flood, scattered
logs and parts of rafts, flotsam and jetsam of the old
wasteful occupants of the land, who cut and dragged
priceless timber to the grudging stream, and lost the
more the more they labored.</p>

<p>He turned to the right, followed down the muddy
river bank, and within a quarter of a mile turned yet
again to the right at a decrepit gate serving in part to
stop the way as adjutant of a broken rail fence which
marked a scanty field.</p>

<p>Before him now lay a cleared space of some twenty
acres or more, occupied at one corner by spare, gnarled
apple trees, no man might say how old, appurtenances
of acres which David Joslin had “heired” from the
husband of the same grandam, whom but now he had
left. Behind the apple trees rose a low roof, the
broken cover of a scant gallery, a chimney, ragged-topped,
at each end of the cabin. Here and there stood
a China tree, yonder grew a vine, softening somewhat
and beautifying even in the beauty of decay those
rude surroundings. Back of the house were other
small log buildings, cribs scantily filled with corn. In
the barnyard stood two tall poles, behind which, running
up into the darkness of the mountain side,
stretched the long rusted wires which in the harvesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of the autumn sometimes carried down from the
side of the mountains, too steep for the use of horse
or mule, the sacks of corn perilously gathered above
and sent down in the easiest way to the farmyard.</p>

<p>Apparently the harvest that fall had been but scant.
The place had an air of poverty, or meagerness&mdash;rather
perhaps should one use the latter than the former
word. It was not the home of a drunkard, or a
ne’er-do-well, or a poverty-smitten man, which David
Joslin now approached&mdash;his own home, one like to
many others all about him in these hills. It was an
old, old, out-worn land, a decrepit land, which lay
all about him. He was like his neighbors, his home
like theirs.</p>

<p>David Joslin walked past the China tree and up to
his own door. He stood for a moment scraping the
mud from his feet at the end of the broken board on
the little gallery before he pushed open the door. A
woman rose to meet him.</p>

<p>She was a woman yet young, but seemed no longer
young. Perhaps she was twenty-two, perhaps twenty-five
years of age. She was tall and strong, after the
fashion of the mountain woman, angular, spare. The
thin dark hair, swept smoothly back from her bony
forehead, seemed to come from a scalp tight-grown
upon the skull. She appeared to carry about her the
look of a certain raw, rugged strength, though there
was little of the soft and feminine about her figure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
about her attitude, about her voice as she now spoke
to him.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t ye come home long ago?” she demanded
with no preliminary.</p>

<p>Joslin made no answer, but sat down sullenly in a
chair which he pushed up to the fireplace. The flames
were dying down into a mass of coals which likewise
seemed sullen. He reached out to the scant pile of
firewood at the corner of the hearth, and cast on a
stick or so.</p>

<p>“Ye’re always away,” she went on grumbling.
“Folks’ll think ye don’t care nothin’ fer yore own
fam’ly. Every whip-stitch ye’re off up into the hills,
visitin’ somewhars or other, I don’t know whar.
What’s it comin’ to?”</p>

<p>Still he made no answer, and she went on upbraiding.</p>

<p>“We been married four years, an’ ye act as free
as if we’d nuvver been married at all. Don’t yore
fam’ly need nothin’ now an’ agin? Is this all a
womern’s got to live fer, I want to know? Look what
kind of place we got.”</p>

<p>“Hit’s all ye come from,” he said at length. “Hit’s
all yore people ever knowed, er mine. Why should
ary of us expect more?”</p>

<p>An even, dull, accepted despair was in his tone. As
for her, she cared not so much for philosophy as for
the heckling she had held in reserve for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hit’s a lot to offer ary womern, hain’t it?” said
she.</p>

<p>“Had ye much to offer in exchange?” said he,
quietly and bitterly. “We traded fair, the best we
knowed, the same sort of trade that’s common. We
got married&mdash;thar was our children. What more is
thar fer ye er em er ary of us in these hills, I’d
like to know! Such as I’ve had, ye’ve had.”</p>

<p>There was something so stern, so bitter, in his sudden
unkind remark that she took another tack.</p>

<p>“Hain’t ye tired?” she began, wheedling. She
stooped over and pulled back the coverlet, a gaudy,
patchwork quilt upon the single bed of the apartment.
“Don’t ye want to lay down an’ rest a while?”</p>

<p>“No. I’m a-thinkin’.”</p>

<p>“What was ye thinkin’ about&mdash;me?”</p>

<p>“No, I was thinkin’ about the new doctor, an’ what
he said to me last week.”</p>

<p>She was silent now. The name of the new doctor
seemed to be something she had heard before.</p>

<p>“Ye talk too much with that new doctor. He puts
too many fool ideas in yore haid. We’re married, an’
we got to live like that. How do ye figger any different,
I’d like to know? Ye brung me here yore
own self&mdash;ye knowed what ye wanted when ye
come up thar courtin’ me at my daddy’s at the haid
of Bull Skin. I come right down here to yore house
when I was married. I stood right on this floor here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
an’ yore daddy, he married us. Ye know that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do.” The young man’s face was extremely
grave and gray as he spoke.</p>

<p>“&mdash;An’ yore daddy was a regular ordained
preacher.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with ye, anyways?” she went
on querulously. “Ye been a-quarlin’ with yore own
people well as me?”</p>

<p>“My own daddy jest now ordered me outen his
house. I’m nuvver goin’ thar no more.”</p>

<p>“Huh! I reckon yore own free-thinkin’ ways druv
it on ye.”</p>

<p>“He burned my fiddle!” said David Joslin, with sudden
resentment.</p>

<p>“Ye mought have expected it&mdash;goin’ up thar to
play a fiddle in a preacher’s house!”</p>

<p>“I jest had her strung up for the fust time,” rejoined
her husband. “I was a-playin’ ‘Barbara Allen.’
My daddy accused me of bein’ sinful. We’ve got it
hard enough livin’ in these hills without being damned
when we die.”</p>

<p>“Hush, Dave! Be keerful of what ye say.”</p>

<p>“I’m a-bein’ keerful. I’m castin’ up accounts this
very day. I been castin’ up accounts fer some time.
I’m thinkin’ of what that new doctor said to me. <i>That</i>
was preachin’ sich as I nuvver heern tell of afore in
these hills. I wish’t he’d come here an’ stay right
along.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>She made no answer now, but pulled out the rude
board table at the side of the fire, and placed upon it
a yellowed plate or so, holding a piece of cold cornpone,
a handful of parched corn.</p>

<p>“Eat,” said she. “Hit’s all we got. I borrowed
some meal from the Taggarts. They’ve got no more
to lend.”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask nothin’ of no one, womern. I’ll not be
beholden to ary man. I tell ye, I’m castin’ up accounts.”</p>

<p>“What do ye mean&mdash;what ye talkin’ about, Dave?”
She was half-frightened now.</p>

<p>“I hardly know. I kain’t see very much light jest
yit.”</p>

<p>“Hain’t ye goin’ to eat?” she said. “Hain’t ye
goin’ to sleep? Hain’t ye goin’ to lay down on the
bed?”</p>

<p>“No!” said he. “No! Our children laid thar onct&mdash;them
two. They died. It was best they died.
They’re our last ones.”</p>

<p>“What do ye mean, Dave?” she again demanded,
wide-eyed. “What do ye mean&mdash;ye hain’t a-goin’
to sleep here with me agin&mdash;nuvver?”</p>

<p>“No, I told ye. I said I was a-castin’ up accounts.
Meliss’, I’ve got to go away.”</p>

<p>“Ye hain’t a-goin’ to quit me?”</p>

<p>“I don’t like that word. I nuvver quit nobody nor
nothin’ that I owed a duty to. But I’ve got to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
away. Hit hain’t right fer ye an’ me to live together
no more. Children&mdash;why, my God!”</p>

<p>“Dave! Air ye crazy? Hain’t I been a good and
faithful womern to ye? Tell me!”</p>

<p>He did not answer her.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Dave&mdash;have ye&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No! I’ve been as faithful as ye. We made our
mistake when we was married&mdash;we mustn’t make it
no more an’ no wuss.”</p>

<p>“The new doctor!” She blazed out now with scorn,
contempt, indignation, all in her voice.</p>

<p>“Yes!” he replied suddenly. “The new doctor&mdash;ary
doctor&mdash;ary man with sense could have told us
what he told me. I know now a heap of things I
nuvver knowed&mdash;what my pap an’ mammy nuvver
knowed.”</p>

<p>“Ye’re a-goin’ to quit me like a coward!”</p>

<p>“I quit nobody like a coward. I hain’t a coward,
Meliss’, an’ you know it. I’m a-goin’ to quit ye because
I’m a brave man. I’ve got to be as brave as
ary man ever was in the Cumberlands to do what I’ve
got to do. Do ye think it’s easy fer me? Don’t
ye think I hear my own children cryin’ still&mdash;mine
as much as yours? An’ this was all I have to give
them. Thank God they died! They’d nuvver orter
of been borned.”</p>

<p>His wife sank into a chair, her hands dropped limp
in her lap. His own hands were trembling as, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
a long time, he turned toward her; his voice trembled
also.</p>

<p>“Look around us in these hills,” said he, his lips
quivering. “Think of what’s in them coves back fer
fifty mile yan way, and yan, and yan, up the Bull Skin,
up the Redbird, up Hell-fer-Sartin an’ Newfound an’
the Rattlesnake an’ the Buffalo&mdash;houses like
ours&mdash;whisky&mdash;killin’&mdash;cousins.”</p>

<p>“Cousins?” Her voice was hoarse. “Why not?”</p>

<p>“Whisky&mdash;killin’&mdash;cousins!” he repeated. “I don’t
know which is the wust, but I reckon the cousin part
is. <i>We was cousins!</i> Thar’s <i>cousins</i> back in our family,
both sides, as far as we know. Those children&mdash;thank
God! Thar’ll be no more.”</p>

<p>Now indeed a long, long silence fell between them.
The woman was pale as death as she turned to him at
last, to hear his self-accusing monotone.</p>

<p>“God knows what I’m a-goin’ to do. But one thing
shore, if I’ve sinned I’ve got to pay. I reckon it’s
a-goin’ to be a right big price I’ve got to pay. Thar’s
a wall around us&mdash;hit’s around these mountings&mdash;hit
shets us all out from all the world. Do ye reckon,
Meliss’, if I was able to make a way through&mdash;do ye
reckon they’d say I’d paid?”</p>

<p>“Ye talk like a fool, man!” said she with sudden
anger, “like a fool! Ye let a limpy, glass-eyed doctor
stir ye all up and fill yer haid with fool idees. Ye
say ye’re a-goin’ to quit me, that had our babies&mdash;because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of what? Yore duty’s to me&mdash;to me&mdash;me!
Ye married me. I want live children&mdash;hit’s a disgrace
when a womern don’t have none. Hit’s yore
business to take care of me, an’ now ye say ye’re
a-goin’ to quit me. Ye’re a coward, that’s what ye
air, the wustest coward ever was in these mountings.
I don’t want furrin ways myself&mdash;I don’t want to go
Outside&mdash;I don’t want ary of them new doctors
comin’ in here, fetched on from Outside. This is
our country, an’ it’s good enough. Ye talk about
leavin’ me. Thar’s some other womern somewhars&mdash;that’s
what’s the matter with ye, Dave Joslin, an’ I
know it!”</p>

<p>He rose now, gray, pallid, half-tottering as he stood
under her tirade.</p>

<p>“That’s not true,” said he at last “I don’t reckon
ye understand me, er what I mean, er what I think.
The only question is, what’s right. We hain’t livin’
the way folks orter do to-day. The new doctor tolt
me what’s Outside. Why, womern, that’s the world&mdash;that’s
life! More’n that&mdash;a heap more’n that&mdash;that’s
duty! If I stay here an’ make a little corn an’ raise
a couple of hogs a year, livin’ with ye an’ raisin’ a
couple more of childern, I hain’t livin’ the way I’d
orter. If we wasn’t cousins&mdash;if I didn’t know now
it’s a sin to live on this way&mdash;I wouldn’t quit ye&mdash;I’d
die first. I hain’t <i>a-goin’</i> to quit ye now. As long
as I got a dollar in the world it’s yores. I’ll hep ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
more by goin’ out. An’ I’m a-goin’ out&mdash;I’m a-goin’
Outside.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry fer ye, Meliss’,” said he presently, as
she sat stone-cold. “I’m sorry fer all of the wimern
like ye in these mountings, sorry fer us all. God
knows I don’t want to make it harder fer ye&mdash;only
easier. Hit’s just a question o’ what’s the right thing
to do.”</p>

<p>There was a vast softness, a great pity in his voice
as he spoke now. He stood irresolute, and his eyes,
in spite of himself, turned sideways to where once had
lain two small bundles at the foot of the unkempt bed.</p>

<p>“Ye coward!” she cast at him, bitter and intense.
“Ye low-borned coward! Ye’re a-goin’ to quit me,
mother of yore dead childern. Well, go on along. I
won’t ax ye to stay. Git along.”</p>

<p>“My granny she’s a-goin’ to take keer o’ ye,” said
David Joslin. “She’ll be kind to ye, an’ ye’ll have no
babies to bother over nuvver. Don’t&mdash;don’t talk to
me no more. I reckon I kain’t stand no more.”</p>

<p>He stepped to the mantel, took from it the old faded
book that lay there&mdash;no more and nothing else of all
in the house that had been his. Then he turned toward
his own door.</p>

<p>She heard his slow footsteps stumbling through the
sodden grass. There closed behind him for the second
time that evening a door opening upon what he had
once called home.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="pch">THE BLOOD COVENANT</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">DAVID JOSLIN turned from his own wastrel
fire, his own decrepit gate, as but now he
had from his father’s, and he did not look
back at what he had left. Steadily his feet slushed
forward, as he held his course through the dripping
rain, faced now up the valley of the stream near which
he lived. Here and there, on this side or that of the
swollen river, showed infrequent lights at the windows
of homes&mdash;each a hospitable home where he would be
welcome at any time of the day or night. But he
did not turn to any one of these, homeless as he was
himself.</p>

<p>For a considerable distance he kept to the valley
until finally he turned into a narrow, deeply sheltered
ravine which as he knew had no occupant. It was a
wild, uncultivated spot, the mouth of the gulch known
as Semmes’ Cove. At its foot trickled a stream of
water leading far back into the hills through a district
where as yet home-building man had not come.
The tall trees still stood here unreaped&mdash;the giant
white oaks and the tremendous trees known as “old-time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
poplar,” among which not even the slightest garnering
had as yet been done by timber-hunting man.</p>

<p>There were secrets of a certain sort up this gulch,
as David Joslin knew. Few men openly went into the
mouth of this wild ravine, and there was no definite
path up the creek such as marked most of the others
thereabout. None the less Joslin in the darkness of
the night turned into it as one wholly familiar with
the vicinity.</p>

<p>He was a woodsman, a wild man fit to conquer and
prevail in any wild land. He went now about the
business he purposed as steadily as though he were
well accustomed to it. With not even the slight assistance
of an occasional star, he found the trunk of a
giant poplar tree which had fallen&mdash;perhaps he knew
it from his many wanderings here. The bark upon
the trunk was dry, and with the aid of a broken
branch he loosed a long fold, sufficient for a roof
when propped up on the trunk of the tree itself. He
felt within the rotted trunk and drew out an armful of
rotted but dry wood, which made him good floor
enough for his bed, keeping him above the dampness.
A part of it also offered punk for the tinder which he
found within the breast of his own blouse. Here also
were the primitive tools of the frontiersman in this
land&mdash;flint and steel. And with flint and steel David
Joslin now managed to build himself a fire even in the
dripping rain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>He cast himself down, not to sleep, but to ponder
and to brood. The wall of blackness shut him in all
about, but before him passed continually the panorama
of his dreams.</p>

<p>The night wore through, and at length the gray
dawn came. The wind was rising now, high in the
tops of the trees, and the air was colder since the rain
had ceased. Any but a hardened man who had slept
thus would have waked stiffened and shivering. Not
so Joslin, who rebuilt his fire and looked about him
for something with which to stay a hunger natural
after twenty-four hours of abstinence. A few fallen
nuts from the trees, a frozen persimmon or so, made
all the breakfast he could find. In his cupped hand
he drank from the little stream. In a few moments
he was at the débouchement of the creek trail leading
up to his father’s home. He halted here as he
heard the sound of hoof-beats coming down the
stream bed.</p>

<p>A rider came into view making such speed as he
could down the perilous footing. He drew up his
horse, startled at seeing a man here, but an instant later
smiled.</p>

<p>“That ye, Dave?” said he. “Ye had me skeered
at fust.”</p>

<p>“What’s yore hurry? Whar ye goin’?”</p>

<p>“Hurry enough&mdash;I was a-comin’ atter ye,”</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“Plenty’s wrong&mdash;yore daddy’s daid&mdash;right up
thar.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?&mdash;What do ye mean?” demanded
Joslin. “Daid&mdash;I left him last night&mdash;he was well.”</p>

<p>“Huh! He’s daid now all right,” rejoined the rider,
finding a piece of tobacco, from which he bit a chew.
“I was a-goin’ down atter ye. I seed him a-hangin’
thar right by his neck on a tree this side the house.
He must of hung hisself, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“That’s a lie,” said Joslin. “My daddy kill hisself&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Come on an’ see then. If he hain’t daid by now,
my name hain’t Chan Bullock! He’s done finished
what old Absalom started. I rid over to the house to
see how he was a-gittin’ along, an’ I come spang on
him when I come down offen the hill. He was still
a-kickin’ then.”</p>

<p>David Joslin approached him, his hands hooked as
though to drag him from his horse. But an instant
later he curbed his wrath, caught at the stirrup strap
of the rider’s horse, swung the horse’s head up the
stream, and urged it into speed, himself running alongside
with great strides which asked no odds.</p>

<p>He found full verification of all the messenger had
told him. From the forked branch of a tree, extending
out beyond the steep side of the bank, swung a
grim bundle of loose clothing covering what but now
had been a strong man. A quick sob came into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
throat of David Joslin as he sprang to the bank. Even
as he did so he heard the sound of footsteps coming.
The bent and broken figure of Granny Joslin came
into view.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong here? Who was that I heerd a-hollerin?&mdash;&mdash; My
God A’mighty, who’s a-hangin’
thar?&mdash;&mdash; My son&mdash;my son!”</p>

<p>She also was endeavoring to scramble up the bank.</p>

<p>“Was it ye a-hollerin’? Why didn’t ye cut him
down, ye fool?” she demanded of Bullock, who still
sat on his horse.</p>

<p>“Hit hain’t lawful, Granny,” said he. “Ye mustn’t
cut him down.”</p>

<p>“I’d cut him down if I was damned fer it,” cried
the old dame. “Ye coward, how long since ye seen
this? When ye hollered? Was he livin’ then? Ye
mought have saved his life. Git outen my way, boy,”
she said to her grandson, and an instant later she herself,
old as she was, had leaned far out along the
branch and with a stroke of the knife she always carried
had cut loose the rope. There was a thudding,
sliding fall. The body of old Preacher Joslin rolled
to the foot of the bank among the sodden leaves.</p>

<p>Bullock dismounted and stood looking down at the
limp figure. But David pushed him aside.</p>

<p>“Leave him be,” said he, and so he slipped his arms
around the body of his father, and, lifting him, strode
up along the little stream bed to the home now left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the more desolate and abandoned. The dead man’s
mother, dry-eyed, hobbled along behind. She showed
where the body might be laid.</p>

<p>“He hain’t daid yit, I most half believe,” said she,
laying her hand on his heart. “Lay him down here,
boys, on his own bed. Thar kain’t no one prove then
he didn’t die in his own bed. The Gannts didn’t git
him.”</p>

<p>If there was indeed a fluttering gasp or two at the
lips after they had placed the body of Preacher Joslin
upon his own bed in his own house, it was but the last
that marked the passing. When not even this might be
suspected, Granny Joslin broke into a sort of exalted
chant of her own invention.</p>

<p>“I got a son!” she crooned in her shrill, high voice.
“He’s strong an’ tall. He hain’t a-feared. He has
the hand to kill. He’ll slay ‘em all. He’ll strow the
blood. He’ll make the fight fer me an’ him an’ all
of us!”</p>

<p>She chanted the words over and over again, the
kindling of her dark eyes a fearsome thing to see.
Now and again she turned from the dead man to the
motionless figure of his son, who stood at his bedside.</p>

<p>“He’ll strow the blood,” she sang. “He’ll kill ‘em
all!</p>

<p>“May God curse old Absalom Gannt an’ all his kin,”
she said at last, shaking a skinny hand toward heaven.
“I pledge ye to it, Davy. Tell the last one of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
all’s gone, we’ll not fergit. Oh, Davy, it was fer this
that ye was borned!”</p>

<p>They stood thus, a grim enough group, when the
sound of hoofs in the creek bed intruded. Bullock
stepped to the door and accosted the newcomer.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Cal,” said he. “Light down an’ come in.”</p>

<p>The rider dismounted, casting his bridle rein across
the top of a picket.</p>

<p>“Andy home?” asked he.</p>

<p>“Well, he is an’ he hain’t,” said Bullock. “Come
on in.”</p>

<p>“Well, I thought I’d come in an’ see him&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Come in. Ye can see all thar is of him,” and he
led the way.</p>

<p>“Good God A’mighty! God damn <i>me</i>!” exclaimed
the visitor, as he caught sight of what lay on the bed
in the room to which they led him. “Granny, how
come this? He’s daid!”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s daid,” said Granny Joslin calmly. “He
hung hisself down below by the spring right now. Ye
kin see whar the rope cut in his neck. He was a-breathin’
when they put him thar. If that fool boy
Chan had had any sense at all he’d of cut him down
an’ done saved him.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, Granny,” began the accused one.
“Well, now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wait!” David Joslin raised his own hand.
“Granny, don’t say that. Hit’s the wish of the Lord.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Blessed be the name of the Lord. I think my father
is better off. Sence he wished it, let’s call it well an’
good. I reckon it all got too much fer him.”</p>

<p>“Well, I was just a-comin’ down,” said the newcomer,
Calvin Trasker, “to ask ye all out fer a little
frolic to-night over to Semmes’ Cove. They’re a-goin’
to draw out this evening, an’ a lot of the neighbors’ll
be thar, like enough.”</p>

<p>“Old Absalom?” asked the tall young man, unemotionally.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he nodded, “him an’ his boys.”</p>

<p>“Not all of ‘em,” said the old dame suddenly. “My
boy fixed a couple of them people yesterday afore they
got him. Lookahere, whar old Absalom cut him”&mdash;her
long, bony finger pointed out the spot. “Spite of
‘em he wouldn’t of died. He killed <i>hisself</i>, an’ he
died in his own bed. Thar kain’t no Gannt on airth
say they killed my boy.”</p>

<p>David Joslin quietly walked over to the foot of the
bedstead and unbuckled the belt of the heavy, worn
revolver which he found hanging there&mdash;the revolver
without which his father rarely had traveled in his
circuit riding. This he fastened about his own waist,
accepting the burden of his father’s feud. He made
no comment.</p>

<p>“Well, now, how come that diffikilty, Granny?
Whar were it?” asked Trasker. “War he hurt bad?”</p>

<p>“He got worse along towards mornin’,” said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
dead man’s mother. “I seen myself that he war cut
deep in his innards, an’ couldn’t live long noways.
He lay all night a-beggin’ me to see that case he died
the rest of us would kerry on the quarl fer him. Now
ye say Absalom an’ some of his folks is a-goin’ to be
over thar to-night?”</p>

<p>The visitor nodded.</p>

<p>“That’s a mighty good thing,” said Granny Joslin,
nodding her own approval. “Go on over, Davy. See
what ye kin do. Will ye promise me ye’ll go?”</p>

<p>“I promise ye, yes, Granny,” replied David Joslin
slowly. “But I’ll tell ye now, it hain’t to my likin’.
I’m only goin’ fer one reason.”</p>

<p>Seeing that they all three stood looking at him in
silence, he went on.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in these fights and feuds no more.
I don’t believe in it even now that it’s come closeter
than ever to me. I don’t believe I’d orter go over thar
an’ kill nobody else jest because they killed my daddy.
Hit hain’t right.”</p>

<p>They looked at him in cold silence. He raised his
hand. “But because I know ye’d all call me a coward
if I didn’t go, I’m a-goin’ over thar with you-all. I’m
a-goin’ over thar before my own daddy is real daid
and buried. I’ll face Absalom Gannt an’ ary of his
kin. I reckon you-all will ride with me. Ye needn’t
have no doubt that I’ll flicker&mdash;I won’t&mdash;none of us
nuvver did. But I’m a-tellin’ ye now I don’t believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
in it, an’ I don’t want to go. I pray on my knees I’ll
not have to kill no man, no matter what happens.”</p>

<p>He felt the strong clutch of a skinny hand at his
arm. His grandmother whirled him about and looked
into his eyes with her own blazing orbs.</p>

<p>“My God, I more’n half believe ye’re a-skeered, Dave
Joslin. God!&mdash;have I fetched into the world ary one
of my name that’s afeerd to kill a rattlesnake like
ary one of them Gannts? I wish to God I was a man
my own self&mdash;I’d show ye. I thought ye was a man,
Dave. Hain’t ye&mdash;tell me&mdash;hain’t ye, David
Joslin?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Joslin, “I don’t think ... a coward!
But I believe the law orter have charge of all these
things. If I kill ary man over thar to-night, I’m
a-goin’ to give myself up to the law.”</p>

<p>“Listen at the fool talk!” broke out his fierce
grandma. “Listen at him. Law?&mdash;law?&mdash;what’s the
law got to do with a thing like this? I reckon we-all
know well enough what the law is.”</p>

<p>“I hope to live to see the real law come into these
mountings yit,” said David Joslin solemnly. “Only
question is, what’s the law? I hope I’ll live to see a
different way of figgerin’ in these hills.”</p>

<p>“Then ye’ll wait till hell freezes,” said Granny
Joslin, savagely. “Hit’ll take more’n ye to reform
the people in these mountings from real men inter
yaller cowards.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come in an’ eat, men,” she added, and led the way
to the side of the table, where presently she brought
a few half-empty dishes&mdash;the same table which soon
would hold the body of the dead man. “What we got
ye’re welcome to. I reckon somehow I kin run this
farm alone an’ make a livin’ here, an’ while I run it
I’ll feed the friends of my fam’ly an’ I’ll shoot the
enemies of my fam’ly that comes, free as if I’d been
a man. God knows I’d orter been, with the trouble I’ve
had to carry. Set up an’ eat.”</p>

<p>“Chan,” said she, after a time, her mouth full of
dry cornpone, “ride up the creek an’ git some of our
kin to jine ye over thar in Semmes’ Cove this evenin’.
They mought be too many fer ye.”</p>

<p>Chan Bullock nodded.</p>

<p>“I’ll go on with Dave up through the cut-off to the
head of the Buffalo, an’ jine Chan an’ the others up
in thar,” said Calvin Trasker. “Ye needn’t be
a-skeered, Granny. Thar’s like enough to be some hell
a-poppin’ in thar afore we hold the funer’l here.
Them Gannts may have a funer’l too.”</p>

<p>“Come around tomorrow, them of ye that’s left
alive,” said the old woman calmly. “We’ll bury him
out in the orchud, whar most of his folks is. Come on
now&mdash;lend me a hand an’ we’ll lift him up on the
table. I don’t reckon he’ll bleed no more now.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE FROLIC AT SEMMES’ COVE</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IT WAS late afternoon when David Joslin and Calvin
Trasker, his kinsman, started into the hills.
They rode in silence as they followed the winding
little path which led up into the wilderness of the upper
ridges. Each was armed with a heavy revolver which
swung under his coat, and each carried in his side
pockets abundance of additional ammunition for his
weapon. Neither spoke. Neither showed any agitation.</p>

<p>They pulled up at the imprint of horses’ hoofs on
the trail coming up from one of the little side
ravines.</p>

<p>Trasker spoke. “Absalom, he don’t live so far off
from here.”</p>

<p>“I wish’t he’d stay at home,” said David Joslin
moodily.</p>

<p>“Look-a-here, Dave,” began the other testily.
“What’s the matter with ye? Is thar arything in this
here talk I heerd about ye feelin’ maybe ye was called
to be a preacher, same as yore daddy?”</p>

<p>Joslin replied calmly. “I don’t know. I’m askin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
fer a leadin’. I kain’t see that this here business is
quite right no more.”</p>

<p>“Ye don’t belong in here then,” said Trasker, and
half drew rein.</p>

<p>“I do belong in here, an’ nowhars else!” said David
Joslin. “If I ever was called&mdash;if I ever come to preach
in these here hills, you-all’ll feel I wasn’t no coward.
I’m a-goin’ to prove it to you-all that I hain’t.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said Trasker succinctly, and again Joslin
led the way up the mountain slope.</p>

<p>They paused presently at the rendezvous where their
kinsmen presently would join them, granted Bullock
had been successful in passing the feudal torch.
Trasker talked yet further.</p>

<p>“He was a great old sport, yore daddy,” said he.
“I reckon he was shot in half a dozen places in his
time. Seemed like they couldn’t kill him, nohow. An’
him an’ old Absalom had it fist an’ skull together
more’n once in their day.”</p>

<p>Joslin nodded. “That was afore he took up preachin’.
Heathen&mdash;why, we all been worse’n ary heathen
in the world. An’ here’s ye an’ me worse’n ary
heathen right now, ridin’ out to squar what only the
hand of God kin squar.”</p>

<p>“Well,” rejoined Trasker, meditatively chewing his
quid, “maybe with four or five of us together we kin
help the hand of God jest a leetle bit. That’s the
leadin’ I git, anyways, for this evenin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, here’s our fellers comin’,” he went on, turning
in his saddle. “Even a few is better’n none.”</p>

<p>They were joined now by three other riders, Chan
Bullock and two younger men, one scarce more than
a boy, the beard not yet sprouted on his face. They
did not make even a salutation as they drew up alongside
the two horsemen who had tarried at the rendezvous.</p>

<p>They turned up the hillside, once more resuming the
winding path along the crooked divide which separated
the two forks of the main stream which bored deep
into the Cumberlands thereabouts. They all knew
well enough the entry point for the head of Semmes’
Cove, and here in due time they halted to hold counsel.</p>

<p>“Sever’l been here,” said David Joslin, pointing out
the horse tracks which led down into the thickets of
the unbroken gulch before them. Without any comment
they all dismounted and advanced, leading their
horses, Joslin ahead. They walked in this way for
perhaps a quarter of an hour. Then Joslin, without
a word, turned and tied his own horse to a tree, the
others following his example.</p>

<p>There had been an illicit stillhouse in this wild
ravine how long none might tell&mdash;in fact, many stillhouses
had been there sporadically and spasmodically
conducted as the fancy of this man or that might determine,
for the region was wild and remote, and never
visited by any of the outside world. These visitors all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
knew well enough where the present stillhouse was
hidden&mdash;in a thicket of laurel just at the edge of a
rock escarpment which jutted out upon the farther
side. They followed on now steadily, alertly, until at
length Joslin raised a hand.</p>

<p>Silently they pushed their way into the edge of the
thicket. Sounds of laughter, of song, greeted them.
A faint, sickish odor rose above the tops of the low
laurel. The visitors, five in all in number&mdash;Joslin,
Calvin Trasker, Chan Bullock, and two other
“cousins,” Nick Cummings and Cole Sennem&mdash;all
pulled up at a point whence they could view the scene,
whose main features they knew well enough without
inspection.</p>

<p>There were a dozen men here and there, taking
turns at the little copper cups which stood upon the
hewn face of a log. A couple of barrels, a copper
pipe between, made pretty much all the visible external
aspect of the still. The great bulb was hidden in
one barrel, the curled copper tube cooled in another.
Here and there lay empty sacks once carrying corn.
A cup-peg or so driven into a tree trunk showed the
openness and confidence with which matters hereabout
had been conducted, and the spot showed every sign of
frequent use.</p>

<p>One of the men, taking up one of the copper vessels
from the low log table, stooped at the pipe at the
foot of one of the barrels, watching the trickle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
white liquid which came forth. He drank it clear
and strong as alcohol, undiluted. Like fire it went
through all his veins.</p>

<p>“Whoopee!” he exclaimed, throwing up a hand.
“I’m the ole blue hen’s chicken! I kin outwrastle er
outjump er outshoot ary man here er anywhar’s else.”</p>

<p>“Ye wouldn’t say that if old Absalom war here,”
laughed a nearby occupant of a rude bench.</p>

<p>“No, nor if Old Man Joslin war, neither.”</p>

<p>“I would too! I hain’t a-skeered o’ nobody,” replied
the warlike youth. “I’ll show ary of ‘em.”</p>

<p>“<i>What’ll ye show us?</i>” demanded David Joslin.
Silent as an Indian he had left the fringe of cover, and
stood now in the open, his eyes steady, his arms folded,
looking at the men before him. And now at his side
and back of him ranged his little body of clansmen.</p>

<p>Sudden silence fell upon all those thus surprised.
They looked at him in amazement.</p>

<p>“Whar’s old Absalom?” he demanded of a man
whom he knew, who stood, the half-finished cup of
liquor still in his hand.</p>

<p>“Air ye lookin’ to start ary diffikilty?” replied his
neighbor, also with a question.</p>

<p>“That’s fer us to say,” said David Joslin. “My
daddy’s daid. He got hurt yesterday by old Absalom
an’ his people. I come over here to-day to see old
Absalom an’ ary kin he happens to have along with
him. Whar is he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Silence for a long time held the group. It behooved
all to be cautious.</p>

<p>“He’s been in here somewhar,” went on Joslin,
“an’ he hain’t fur now. Tell me, is he down at the
dance house?”</p>

<p>“Well, ye mought go an’ see,” rejoined the first
speaker, grinning. “Ye know, Dave Joslin, I hain’t
got no quarl with ye, nor has ary o’ my people. Ye
set right here now, boys,” he continued, sweeping out
a long arm toward the merrymakers, who still lingered
about the liquor barrel.</p>

<p>“Thar’s more of them than thar is of ye,” he whispered
hurriedly to Joslin as he stepped up. “The
house is full, an’ they’re dancin’. Three or four gals
from down on the Buffalo is in thar now. They’re
havin’ a right big frolic.”</p>

<p>Without a word Joslin turned and hurried down
the path. He knew the location of the building to
which reference had been made&mdash;a long log structure
rudely floored with puncheons, sometimes employed
locally as a sort of adjunct of the still. The sounds
of dancing, the music of one or two reedy violins, the
voice of a caller now and then, greeted the party of
avengers who now approached this curious building
hidden in the heart of the mountain wilderness.
Whether or not all of the occupants of the dance house
were of Absalom Gannt’s party, neither David Joslin
nor any one else might tell. There might be a general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
mingling here of friend and foe until some overt act
should light again the ancient fire, forever smouldering.</p>

<p>Joslin beckoned to his companions. “Git behind
them rocks right over thar, boys,” he whispered.
“I’m a-goin’ up to the door.”</p>

<p>The young men with him went about their business
with perfect calmness, although the eye of each was
alert and glittering. They took their stations under
the leadership of the man who they now regarded as
the chieftain of their clan, and watched him go to
what seemed certain death.</p>

<p>Joslin advanced steadily to the door, his thumbs in
the waist band of his trousers. With his left hand he
knocked loudly on the jamb of the door. He spoke to
some one, apparently an acquaintance, who noticed
him.</p>

<p>“Is Absalom Gannt here?” he demanded. “If he is,
tell him to come out. I’ll wait till he comes out fair.”</p>

<p>“Good God A’mighty, Davy,” said the other who
stood within. “Air ye atter trouble? This is jest a
little frolic.”</p>

<p>“Tell him to come out,” repeated Joslin. “I want
Absalom Gannt!” The courage of this deed went into
the sagas of the Cumberlands&mdash;the act of a man who
scorned certain death.</p>

<p>It must have been some friend of Absalom Gannt,
some relative perhaps, who heard this summons and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
saw the gray face of David Joslin staring into the
half-darkened interior. With a shout he himself
sprang to the door, gun in hand. Joslin leaped aside.
As he did so he heard the roar of a heavy revolver
back of him. Chan Bullock, the long blue barrel of
his six-shooter resting on his arm at the top of the
protecting boulder, fired at the man who appeared in
the door. The latter fell forward and slouched over
on his face, his head on his arms.</p>

<p>A half instant of silence, then came the roar of
a pistol at the window near where Joslin stood. The
men at the boulders, in turn, began firing generously
at every crack and cranny of the house, regardless of
who or what might be within. The marksman at the
window was deliberate. With care he rested the barrel
of his weapon against the window sash. At its
third report, Joslin heard back of him a heavy groan,
but he did not see Calvin Trasker roll over on his
back, his doubled arm across his face.</p>

<p>The sound of gunfire now was general on every side.
None might say who was harmed, who as yet was safe.
As for Joslin, he had work to do. Absalom Gannt
was still inside the house.</p>

<p>He stepped forward again deliberately to the door,
pushed aside the man who stood there peering out,
and broke his way into the crowd. Two or three
women, cowering, shrank into the farther corner of
the room. Men stood here and there, each with weapon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
in hand. The acrid taste of gunpowder, which hung
in the blue pall of smoke, was in the nostrils of all.</p>

<p>“Absalom Gannt!” rose the high, clear voice of
David Joslin, “I’ve come fer ye. Come out here an’
meet me fair if ye hain’t a coward. Absalom Gannt!
Absalom Gannt&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>That was the last word the friends of David Joslin
heard him speak, and, as they told the story, it was
apparent that the Joslin blood “never flickered onct.”</p>

<p>What happened to David Joslin they did not know&mdash;he
himself did not. He was perhaps conscious of a
heavy blow at the base of his head, then came unconsciousness,
oblivion. He fell upon the floor of the
rude revel house.</p>

<p>Firing ceased now. The occupants of the cabin
rushed out. The defenders of the line of boulders,
three only in number now, broke and sprang up the
mountain side, pursued by a rain of bullets which
touched none of them.</p>

<p>The frolic at Semmes’ Cove had found its ending&mdash;not
an unusual ending for such scenes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pch">THE AWAKENING OF DAVID JOSLIN</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IN THE old apple orchard of Preacher Joslin&mdash;whose
gnarled trees had been planted by some unknown
hand unknown years ago&mdash;a long and narrow
rift showed in the rocky soil. The owner of these
meager acres was now come to his rest, here by the
side of many others of his kin whose graves, unmarked,
lay here or there, no longer identified under
the broken branches of the trees.</p>

<p>A neighbor blacksmith had wrought sufficient nails
to hold together a rough box. In this he and Granny
Joslin had placed the dead man. Word passed up
and down the little creek that the burying of Andrew
Joslin would be at noon that day; so one by one
horses came splashing down the creek&mdash;usually carrying
a man with a woman back of him, the woman
sometimes carrying one child, sometimes two.</p>

<p>These brought fresh word. Calvin Trasker, killed
in the frolic at Semmes’ Cove, had already been buried.
He was accounted well avenged. It was almost sure
he had killed his man before he had received his own
death wound. As for Chan Bullock and his two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
young cousins, they were no less than heroes. Four
of the Gannt family had been left accounted for,
whether by aim of the fallen or that of the three escaping
feudists none might say. The Joslins had none
the worst of it. Had not one of them&mdash;which, no one
could tell&mdash;fired the shot which broke old Absalom’s
arm? This funeral party, practically a rallying of the
Joslin clan, was no time more of special mourning
than of exultation. The talk was not so much of the
dead man, not so much of the dead man’s son David,
who was still missing, as it was of the victory attained
over the rival clan.</p>

<p>And so they buried Preacher Joslin, and thereafter,
all having been duly concluded, and a simple, unmarked
stone having been set up at the head of his grave, old
Granny Joslin, robbed of her son and her son’s son,
asked them once more to eat of what she had, and so
presently bade them good-by.</p>

<p>“I’ll git along somehow, folks,” said she. “Don’t
you-all worry none about me. If Davy’s daid, why,
he’s daid, an’ that’s all about it. Atter a few days,
you-all go over in thar an’ watch for buzzards an’
crows&mdash;if they hain’t buried him deep, we’ll find out
whar he’s at.”</p>

<p>But after the funeral party had departed, plashing
their way back up the creek-bed road, Granny Joslin
sat down to make her own accounting. David&mdash;her
boy Davy&mdash;the one who understood her&mdash;whom she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
understood so well&mdash;where was he? Had they indeed
killed him? Was he lying out there in the mountains
somewhere, his last resting place unknown to any save
his enemies?</p>

<p>“Curse the last of them&mdash;them cowardly Gannts!”
Again she raised her skinny hand in malediction.
“May mildew fall on them an’ theirs. May their
blood fail to breed, an’ may they know sorrer an’
trouble all their lives! I wish to God I was a
man. Oh, God, bring me back my man&mdash;my boy
Davy!”</p>

<p>But the mountain side against which she looked,
against which she spoke, made no answer to her. She
sat alone. A film came over her fierce eye like that
which crosses the eye of a dying hawk. Whether or
not a tear eventually might have fallen may not be
said, but before that time old Granny Joslin rose, grunting,
and hobbled back into her own desolate home.
She lighted the fire. She set all things in order. The
castle of the Joslins had not yet been taken. But David
came not back that day, nor upon the third, nor yet
upon the fourth day. By that time she had given him
up for dead.</p>

<p>Yet it was upon the morning of that fourth day
that David Joslin himself sat concealed, high upon the
mountain side, and looked down upon the broken home
of Granny Joslin. He saw the smoke curling up from
the chimney, and knew it as the banner of defiance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
He knew that the old dame would live out her life to
its end according to her creed.</p>

<p>His keen eye saw the new mound in the apple orchard&mdash;the
broken clay now dried in the sun of several
days. He could guess the rest. For himself, he was
alive. He had been dead, but now he was born
again.</p>

<p>At the end of the fight in Semmes’ Cove, there was
a general scattering and confusion. The Gannt party
finally had taken care of their own dead and wounded,
and, passing on up the ravine toward the usual paths
of escape, had tarried at the stillhouse only long
enough to refresh themselves as was their need. For
those of the attacking party left behind they had small
care. A man or two was down somewhere behind the
rocks. As for the man who had broken into the house&mdash;David
Joslin&mdash;he was dead. Had they not caught
him neck and crop, and thrown him headlong into the
gully? Yes, one thing was sure, David Joslin was
dead; and he had been the leader of the attack. Therefore,
the Gannts accounted themselves as having won
a coup also for their side of the feud.</p>

<p>When Joslin awoke to the consciousness of bitter
pain, he reached out a hand in the darkness which enshrouded
him. He felt damp earth. So, then, he reasoned,
he was dead and buried, and this was his grave!
For some time he made no attempt to breathe or to
move. Yes, this was his grave. He lay he knew not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
how long in the full realization that life was done for
him.</p>

<p>Then, as the cool of the night refreshed him, he felt
about him, felt the weeping of dew-damp leaves above
him, and slowly reasoned that he was not dead at all,
and not in his grave, but that he had been flung somewhere
here into the bottom of the ravine.</p>

<p>Slowly he struggled to his knees. He staggered up
the side of the slope as best he might, more by chance
than otherwise, taking that side which lay nearest the
dance house. He saw in the gloom the low boulders,
behind which his fighting men had lain. He stumbled
across the dead body of Calvin Trasker, left where he
had fallen. There remained to him sensibility enough
to put the dead man’s hat across his face; but he could
do no more than that. He knew that if he were found
here he would be killed indeed. So, knowing that
there was no longer need for him or chance for him
here, he staggered on down the ravine of Semmes’
Cove, until at length he could go no farther, and so fell
once more unconscious.</p>

<p>When again he awoke it was broad sunshine. How
long he had lain he could not tell. But now thirst assailed
him, thirst which he might quench in the trickle
of water which lay below. The provender of the
woods, a few nuts, a pawpaw or so, seemed grateful
to him now. He staggered on, knowing that it would
be no more than two or three miles down the ravine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
until he came to the little camp he had made in the
rain, after he had left his own home on that unhappy
day. And so at length he found that bivouac and
dropped into the bed of rotten wood once more, and lay
prostrate all that day and the next.</p>

<p>It was really upon the morning of the fourth day
after the encounter&mdash;although Joslin himself could not
have said as to that&mdash;that, strong enough now to walk,
he staggered out of the thicket-covered lower entrance
of Semmes’ Cove into the little creek bed, which made
the path to his father’s home. He must look once
more at the house where he himself was born.</p>

<p>Was born, did he say? No, he had been born a
second time! In these long hours of misery and pain,
David Joslin had taken accounting as best he might
with life and the philosophies thereof. In his fashion
of thought, he had gained the conviction that his “call”
had come to him. He was called for a different life.
There was no doubt about it. New duties lay before
him&mdash;all of a new life&mdash;because he had been born
again! To him his salvation was not less than a miracle,
and he accepted it as such solemnly and reverently,
feeling himself now consecrated fully for some
cause. What the form of that consecration might be
he himself did not clearly know as yet.</p>

<p>But there came to him, with this feeling, the solemn
conviction that he must leave this country. This opportunity
seemed to him providential. No, he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
not even go to say farewell to his wife, nor to greet
his grandma, Granny Joslin, to give counsel to her.
He, being dead, must depart secretly forever from these
hills until he might return to them to do the thing
given him to do.</p>

<p>Such, unnatural and hard as that might seem to
others, was the ancient, grim, uncompromising creed
of David Joslin of the Cumberlands. Let the dead bury
its dead. Let the living live their own lives.</p>

<p>Weakly, slowly, he climbed along the mountain side
above the creek bed, to avoid any passerby, and so at
length reached the point upon the opposing hill whence
he might look down upon the little home once owned
by the man who lay there now, under the drying yellow
ridge in the apple orchard planted by his sires.</p>

<p>How long David Joslin sat here, his chin in his
hands, he himself might not have told. He sat looking
down, pondering, resolving.... Yes, he was born
again! What must he do?</p>

<p>At length he rose, staggeringly rose, seeking about
for some broken branch to aid him further in his
journey. For now he purposed a long, long journey
out from these hills. He was going away from his
own people!</p>

<p>His hand fell against something hard in the side
pocket of his ragged coat. It was the old book he had
borrowed of his father&mdash;the well-thumbed volume of
Calvin’s Institutes. His belt and revolver were gone&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
knew not where&mdash;but here was this ancient, iron
book. He recalled now, with the tenacious memory of
the mountaineer, a passage which he had read therein:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">Truly, I have no refuge but in Him. Let no man
flatter himself, for of himself he is only a devil. For
what have you of your own but sin? Take for yourself
sin, which is your own. Your righteousness belongs to
God. Nature is wounded, distressed and ruined. It
needs a true confession, not a false defense.</p>

<p class="p1">“A true confession&mdash;not a false defense!” All the
honesty, all the ignorance, all the hope of these mountains
were in the mind of David Joslin, as he repeated
these vague words of the old mystic to himself. He
now felt himself a prophet.</p>

<p>And now, a prophet, he was going out into the
world.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE WANDERING WOMEN</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">WHEN Joslin finally rose and set his face
away from the sight of the hearth fire he
had known, with staff and scrip to start out
into the world, he followed along the winding height
of land below the summit leading towards Hell-fer-Sartin&mdash;the
objective of his father’s last circuit riding.
Here he crossed the Bull Skin Valley, fording the shallow
stream, and made directly into the harder going
of the divide between that stream and the Redbird.
Feeding himself as best he might, he lay out yet another
night in the hills; but by this time the seasoned
vigor of his own frame began to reassert itself. He
grew stronger in spite of the pain of his wound, in
spite of his long abstention from wholesome food. He
evaded all sounds of life at the little farms scattered
here and there among the mountains. A rail fence
caused him to turn aside; the sight of a smoke drove
him deeper back into the hills.</p>

<p>It was perhaps ten o’clock of the second morning,
when he found himself on the river trail of a fork
of the Kentucky River, that he paused at the sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of a human voice. It seemed not to be approaching,
but stationary&mdash;a woman’s voice, now raised in some
sort of old ballad tune. It seemed to him he might go
forward.</p>

<p>She sat on a pallet of leaves at the side of the road,
a little above its level, in a sort of natural cave or opening
in the cliff face. A shelf of limestone extended
out perhaps twenty feet, and left under it a sort of
open-faced cavern. The roof was black with many
smokes&mdash;it always had been black with smoke since
the memory of white men in that region; for here,
tradition told, had dwelt the last two Indians of the
Cumberlands, when the whites rallied and slew them
both. This white woman had taken up the ancient
lair of men scarce more wild than she herself seemed
now.</p>

<p>She was an old-seeming woman, albeit perhaps once
comely. Her dark hair, not fully grayed, fell about
a face once small-featured, large-eyed. What charm
she once had had was past or passing; yet something
of her philosophy of life remained, enabling her to
sing at this hour in the morning.</p>

<p>“Howdy, stranger,” she said, looking at him with
a direct and easy familiarity singular enough in the
circumstances, for the mountain women are shy and
silent with men. “Whar ye bound?”</p>

<p>“Howdy,” said David Joslin. “I’m a-goin’ down
the creek a ways.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“If ye air, I wish ye’d see if my darter is along in
the field below. Tell her to come on back home. She’s
got her little girl along with her&mdash;ye’ll know ‘em if
ye see ‘em.”</p>

<p>“Home?” said David Joslin rather vaguely, looking
at the blackened roof of the cavern. The woman
laughed.</p>

<p>“All the home we got, my darter an’ me. We’ve
lived here off an’ on many a year. They call me
Annie. They call her Min. Hit’s no difference about
the rest of the name.”</p>

<p>“I know ye hain’t born in these parts or ye’d know
about us two,” she continued. “This has been my
home&mdash;all I’ve ever had in my life&mdash;I kain’t say how
many years. I move up an’ down. Sometimes I’m
up on Big Creek&mdash;sometimes on the Kaintucky. I
follow the rafts. I’ve even been Outside. Min,
she nuvver has. Some of my other girls has,
maybe.”</p>

<p>“Yore other girls?” began Joslin.</p>

<p>“I’ve had seven children&mdash;four girls,” said she
quietly, unemotionally.</p>

<p>“I don’t know yore fam’ly,” said David Joslin, hesitating
still.</p>

<p>“I hain’t got no fam’ly, I told ye, an’ I don’t come
o’ no fam’ly. Us two lives here together&mdash;we’re the
wanderin’ wimmern&mdash;that’s what they call us in this
country. Don’t ye know about us?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, now”&mdash;and she turned her once bold eyes
upon him with renewed defiance, as he did not reply&mdash;“I
told ye I’d had seven children. Ye want to know
who’s the father of Min? I kain’t tell ye rightly.
She couldn’t tell ye rightly who’s the father of her
girl she’s got along with her now. I’ve had seven
children. Who’s their fathers?&mdash;I don’t know.
What’s more, I don’t keer. What’s the difference?
Who air we, back in the hills? What chancet have
we got?”</p>

<p>Joslin stood leaning on his staff, pale, hollow-eyed,
gaunt. In his eyes was a vast pity, a terrible understanding.</p>

<p>“Kin I wait here for a minute or so?” said he. “I’m
right tired.”</p>

<p>“Ye’ve been hurt,” said she, pointing to his bandaged
head, for which he had made such care as he
might. “Well, I don’t ask ye no questions. I’ve seen
plenty of men hurt, in the raftin’ times.”</p>

<p>“We’re stoppin’ here now,” she went on explaining.
“Because, mought come a tide any time, an’ then the
rafts’ll come. They tie up yander at the big tree thar&mdash;the
men come acrosst. Well, here’s home for Min
an’ me. She’s young. I’m gittin’ pretty old. Few
cares fer such as me.”</p>

<p>Then she went on. “That’s our life, stranger. Ye
kin guess the rest. We’re the wanderin’ wimmern.
There’s no hope fer us. We never had no chancet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“Kin ye read?” asked David Joslin quietly. “Kin
ye write? Kin yore darter?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“I kin read jest a little bit,” said he himself slowly.
“I kin write jest a little bit. Ye say ye’ve had no
chancet. That’s true. What chancet have ary of us
here? Whar can we learn anything? I’m a-goin’
Outside. I’m a-goin’ on a journey.”</p>

<p>“Set down an’ eat,” said she, with the unfailing
hospitality of the mountains. “We hain’t got much.
I kin parch ye some corn, maybe. Min’s down below
trying to find some hickernuts an’ some corn. Folks
don’t mind our foragin’ around. Why, even sometimes
I’ve slept in a cabin now an’ then. They don’t
mind if we sleep in the corn cribs sometimes when the
weather’s cold. The husks is right warm&mdash;warmer’n
leaves, I kin tell ye that.”</p>

<p>Joslin looked about him. A ragged gunny sack or
so, a quilt or two, were heaped into one corner over
a pile of leaves&mdash;there was no other sign of couch.
In another corner of the cavern a blackened spot
showed where they built their fire. With flint and
steel the old woman now began her fire anew. There
was a broken bit of iron, once a skillet. In this she
managed to parch some grains of corn for the traveler.</p>

<p>“Eat, stranger,” said she. “Hit’s from Annie, the
wanderin’ womern, that never had a chancet.”</p>

<p>He ate, and drank from a broken gourd of water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
which she gave to him. For a time he sat looking
across the pageant of the hills, still radiant in their
autumn finery.</p>

<p>At length he placed a hand in his pocket. “Take
this,” said he. “I’ve got just thirty-five cents. I’ll
keep the dime, fer I mought need it. I know the people
in the mountings don’t take pay fer what they give
to eat, but won’t ye please take this?”</p>

<p>“What do ye mean, man?” said she looking at
him curiously, but refusing the money which he offered.
“Ye seem like a quare feller to me. Air ye
outen yore haid?”</p>

<p>“Maybe I got some good sense knocked into my
haid, I don’t know. All I know is I’m a-goin’ Outside.”</p>

<p>“Outside?” The voice of the old woman was low.
“I’ve got some girls&mdash;Outside, somewhar. Ye mustn’t
say they wasn’t my children, for they was. They nuvver
only had no chancet.”</p>

<p>“I know that,” said David Joslin. “That’s why I’m
a-goin’ out. I’m a-goin’ to try some time, somehow,
to make a school, er a church, er something, in these
hills. We’ve got to learn how to read an’ write.
I’ve got a callin’ that that’s what we’d orter do. I
never seen ye before&mdash;maybe I never will again&mdash;but
listen now. Some time, if I ever build a school, I’m
a-goin’ to build another one right in here.” His eyes
were streaming tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll tell ye the place,” said she eagerly. “Down
below, about hafe a mile, thar’s a place whar two stones
come together&mdash;great big ones. Thar’s a level floor
under that, wider’n the floor of this here place, an’ it’s
covered in from the rain. Thar’s leaves thar&mdash;ye could
fetch in pine needles a-plenty if ye wanted to, fer
thar’s pine about. Rain or shine ye could hold school
down thar. Hit would be sich a purty place.”</p>

<p>“Good luck, stranger,” said she. “Ye may be crazy&mdash;I
reckon ye air&mdash;but God knows thar orter be
more crazy people like that in these hills.”</p>

<p>Her guest turned and followed on down the winding
stream in the muddy pathway. A quarter or a
half-mile below, he paused and looked across the vine-covered
remnant of what once had been a rail fence.
He had heard a rustling in the corn, and saw now the
figure of a young woman who stood looking at him;
at her side, clinging to her tattered skirt, a young child,
perhaps four or five years old. This child had in her
little apron a store of nuts, gathered in the wood
beyond. Her mother carried half an armful of ears
of corn.</p>

<p>“Howdy,” called David Joslin across the fence, in
customary salutation of the hills.</p>

<p>“Howdy,” she replied, but still stood motionless.</p>

<p>“Won’t ye come up a little closeter?” he resumed.
“Yore mammy up yander&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The young woman slowly advanced, the child clinging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
still to her skirt. She was a wild-looking creature,
but quite comely, with a sort of Indian cast to her features,
her skin dark, whether with sun or with other
blood none might tell. Her eyes were black as night,
and her figure lean and slender, not quite so angular
as that of the average mountain woman. Young
enough she was, and goodly enough she might have
been if ever she “had had her chance.”</p>

<p>The child at her skirt, an elfin youngster, had much
of her mother’s darkness of hair and eyes, her mother’s
wide mouth of white, even teeth, a thing unusual
thereabouts. She now stood staring straight at the
stranger, motionless and silent.</p>

<p>“Ye’re Min, I reckon,” began David Joslin. “Yore
mammy&mdash;she told me to find ye an’ tell ye to go on
home now, that it’s nearly time fer breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Who air ye, stranger?” asked the young woman.
“Which way ye bound?”</p>

<p>“My name is David Joslin,” he replied. “I live, or
useter live, over on the Bull Skin, near the mouth of
Coal Creek.”</p>

<p>“What’s yore business? Air ye lookin’ fer logs?”</p>

<p>“No, I hain’t. I’m a-goin’ Outside.”</p>

<p>She stood staring at him, uncertain, silent, awkward.
David Joslin returned her gaze with his own
frank, gray eyes. “Ye’ve lived jest the way ye could,”
said he. “Ye needn’t tell me nothin’. I know about
the raftsmen. I’ve been a raftsman myself. I’ve been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Outside many times. I run down the other fork, don’t
ye see? I’m yore own sort of people. I hain’t no
better’n ye, God knows.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to be goin’ now,” he added. “I hope to
see ye agin some time in here. I’m jest a-goin’ Outside
fer a little while, ontel I can learn to read an’
write.”</p>

<p>“I reckon ye don’t know all about us&mdash;my mammy
and me,” she began, a slow flush now upon her face.
This was a different sort of man&mdash;a preacher, perhaps?</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I do. I know all I need to know or want
to know. I know ye nuvver had no chancet.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say good-by now,” he added, extending a hand,
which wandered to the tangled crown of the little girl.</p>

<p>And so he turned and left her standing there, the
child at her side, the wild forage of the mountains to
be their sustenance no one might say yet how long.
When the raftsmen came&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE FABRIC OF A VISION</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE mountaineer’s keen eye noted a change in
the river along which his pathway led. There
had been rain back in the hills, and now what
the mountaineers call a “tide” was coming down,
discoloring the stream. Passing more than one abandoned
raft, its logs submerged in the sand, at length
he stopped, having spied a pair of great logs of
the yellow poplar, such as the raftsmen use as floaters
for the hardwood logs they make up into their rafts.
Himself an experienced river man, he saw now the
means of hastening his progress.</p>

<p>With aid of a hardwood lever, he managed to get
both his logs afloat in the deep pool at whose edge they
lay. Waist deep he waded, binding his logs together
with a length of grapevine, which he tore from a nearby
tree. He found here and there some bits of boards,
flotsam and jetsam of the stream, and on these, spread
crosswise, he laid bits of brush, making a little mound
midships of his craft. When presently he had found
a twelve-foot pole for guiding oar, he had done his
work in building himself a boat. He stepped aboard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
it with the confidence of the river man. He knew the
stream would carry him three, four or five miles an
hour, sometimes six miles, in its more rapid reaches.
He advanced, bend after bend, through a beautiful
panorama of flame-decked river banks now gilded by
the failing sun. He heard sometimes the bells of wandering
cattle, now and again the lowing of a cow, the
neighing of a horse; and saw by the river banks many
a home of a mountaineer who had settled here none
might say when. But the eyes of David Joslin were
not for these things.</p>

<p>It was sunset when the hurrying flood of the river
brought him to the mouth of that other tributary in
whose valley he himself had dwelt all these years.
Here was the confluence of the two main forks of the
Kentucky. He knew every house of the little village
at the forks, every feature of the hills, which rose
about the village on either side.</p>

<p>He swung straight past, on the bosom of the rising
and augmented river, his craft swimming steadily
enough under his accustomed guidance. He scarce
saw the little houses, their smoke rising for the evening
meal. It was something more which came to his
gaze as he traveled here.</p>

<p>He saw, or thought he saw&mdash;it might have been but
the ragged heads of thunder clouds beyond the rim
of the hills&mdash;the roofs and stacks of buildings&mdash;not
one, but many buildings. They sat there on the hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
that rose above the town&mdash;yes, he was sure of it.
There were many of them&mdash;there was a city of them!
Yonder on the hill there stood again visualized the
thing which he had dreamed! It was but a vision,
caught for an instant as the yellow flood of the river
swept him on, but it was enough for David Joslin. A
strange confidence came to him. He felt all the
zeal of the old covenanters, the assurance that
God was with him, and that his “calling” now was
clear.</p>

<p>But the Kentucky River, coming into full tide,
mocked at a man who thought of anything else but
things at hand. Joslin knew what was on ahead a
few miles&mdash;the great Narrows of the Kentucky, fatal
to many a raft and many a raftsman. Here, at the
foot of a long reach of still water, lay a great rock
dam, where the hillsides came close together. The
river, narrowed and compressed, was flung furiously
out over the rock ledge, to drop a certain distance, and
then to curl up and back in a high white wave extending
entirely across the stream&mdash;what the raftsmen
always called the “king breaker” of the Narrows.</p>

<p>There was a sort of pathway along the sides of the
Narrows, by which one could come below the big
swell, but Joslin, whether moody and distrait, whether
in indifference, or whether resolved to take his chances
and test his fate, made no attempt to land his frail
craft. He headed straight for the great stretch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
slack water, which lay above the rolling crest of the
Narrows.</p>

<p>Always he had been chosen steersman for his raft
in the river work he knew, and he knew this spot well
enough&mdash;the fatalities which attended it&mdash;but he did
not hesitate, and with his long sweep straightened his
craft for what he knew would be the great plunge.
He took it fair, crouching forward, his knees bent, his
eyes ahead, just as he had steered more than one raft
through in earlier times, and caught the full blow of
the great wave, as he plunged from the darkness into
the white of the stream, now under the blanket of the
twilight in the deep defile.</p>

<p>He was flung entirely free of his two logs, as they
were rent asunder by the force of the swell. He went
down into the white&mdash;how deep he could not tell&mdash;perhaps
halfway down to the bottom of the great
pool which lay below the Narrows. He emerged,
dazed, but his arm found no supporting logs&mdash;the two
had been flung far apart, and by this time were rolling
down the middle course of the white water. With
what strength remained to him, he struck out for the
right-hand shore, and had strength enough to fling
up a hand and ease himself of the current along the
rock ledge.</p>

<p>For a time he swung, breathing hard, then drew
himself up and out, and lay flat upon the rocks. It
was almost night, and it was cold. He was chilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and weak. He had traveled long and far without rest,
and without sufficient food. But the rugged rearing he
had had stood him once more in stead. He managed
once more, by means of his priceless flint and steel, to
build him a little fire, though how he lived through the
night he scarce could say.</p>

<p>He knew that it was thirty miles down to the first
settlement below, and that there were few houses between.
He must walk. Half barefooted, penniless,
hungered, wearied and weak, he staggered on as though
a man in a trance. At least he was able to make his
painful way all those weary miles. It was again evening,
and late, when at length he saw the red lights
of the little mill town of Windsor, where more than
once before then he had pulled up with others of the
wild raftsmen, among whom he had spent his youth.</p>

<p>He was at the edge of the great Outside. This was
Ultima Thule for the hardwood rafts. And all of
Thule, all of the great, unknown, mysterious world lay
on beyond. It was a wild figure that this gaunt and
haggard young man presented as, hesitant, he stood
gazing out at the habitations in which, near at hand
to which, beyond which, must lie the answers to the
questions of his soul. He saw not the town where the
rafts landed. In his mind still lived the vision of yon
other city on the hill.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="pch">MARCIA HADDON, AND THE MERRY WIFE OF WINDSOR</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE single hotel of Windsor was a raw and
rambling structure, for the most part frequented
by raftsmen and mill hands. Joslin
knew the proprietor, commonly known as Old Man
Bent. That worthy stood quizzically regarding the
young man, as the latter accosted him, and explained
his almost penniless plight.</p>

<p>“Ye’re plumb wore out, an’ I can see it,” said he.
“Go in an’ go to bed, atter ye’ve had a squar’
meal, an’ don’t say nothin’ about pay ontel times is better
fer ye. Hit’s many a dollar ye’ve paid to me, raftin’
times.”</p>

<p>Without further word, Joslin stepped into the dining
room, and ate his first real meal for more than a
week&mdash;ate ravenously, like any animal; and all that
night he slept in a stupor of exhaustion.</p>

<p>When morning came once more he found his host.
“I’ve got to git work,” said he. “I kain’t live here
withouten I go to work right away. Ye know that.”</p>

<p>Old Man Bent looked at him with pursed lips. “I’ll
tell ye what I’d do. Ye go down to Jones’ brick yard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
an’ see if he’ll give ye something to do fer a little
while, ontel ye kin turn yoreself somehow.”</p>

<p>The Windsor brick yard was run by a man by the
name of Jones, who himself was not above driving a
canny bargain, as he noted the stalwart figure of this
applicant.</p>

<p>“I could put ye to work carryin’ the molds from
the mixer out to the dryin’ yard,” said he. “Sixty
cents a day ain’t much, but I kin git plenty of men at
that. They mostly work barefoot, anyways.” He
glanced down at Joslin’s shoeless feet, worn with the
hard going.</p>

<p>So this was David Joslin’s first encounter with the
great outside world&mdash;for so even this village might be
termed. Without murmur he went to work&mdash;twelve
hours a day, with a back-breaking load each trip, carrying
the wet clay of the molded bricks. The reflex of
the wound in his head gave him a continuous headache.
He still was weak. But he worked that day and
the next. Then once more he went to his landlord.</p>

<p>“I kain’t nohow make it even,” said he. “I don’t
feel right payin’ ye only fifteen cents a day, when I
know ye charge everybody else a dollar. I been eating
only two meals here now, trying to make it easier
for ye.”</p>

<p>Old Man Bent understood the stern quality of the
mountain character well enough, and accepted, at its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
face value, the rugged independence of the man before
him.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell ye what I’d do if I was in yore place,
Dave,” said he. “I’d go over to the Widow Dunham’s
place. She ain’t got no man there now to hep her
aroun’, an’ her regular price for board is only three-fifty
a week. Maybe ye could manage to git a place
to sleep an’ three squar’ meals a day.”</p>

<p>After his fashion, silent, Joslin nodded, and forthwith
went over to the boarding house of the Widow
Dunham, a few streets distant from the hotel. He
placed before that dame a fair statement of his own
case, explaining that sixty cents a day was all he was
earning, that he was very, very hungry, but that he
could perhaps do with two meals a day. The widow
smilingly estimated the tall young man before her,
reviving a somewhat ancient dimple as she did so.</p>

<p>“Men is mostly troublesome,” said she. “I’ve married
two of ‘em in my time. The first one was kilt out
in the hills, and the second one was so triflin’ he went
out into the Blue Grass, an’ I never did hear from him
no more. I orter have some sort of man around the
place to fetch in the water an’ git me some wood now
an’ then. Ye come in and take keer of them chores
like, an’ pay me fifty cents a day, an’ we’ll call it
even.</p>

<p>“Ye’d orter have a pair of shoes, by right,” added
she, “an’ maybe a coat. Sometimes I have quality come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
here to my place&mdash;I’m expectin’ some any time now
from outside. Mr. James B. Haddon of New York,
him and his wife is comin’ in, he writ me. Natural,
if I have folks like them around ye’d orter have a
pair of shoes an’ a good coat, anyways of nights.”</p>

<p>She stepped back into her own well-ordered domicile,
and presently emerged with a pair of shoes, not
much worn. To these she added a coat, which, beyond
question, never had seen fabrication in this part of the
world.</p>

<p>“Here’s something that Mr. Haddon lef’ here, last
time he was in. He goes back into the hills, or leastways
he intended to if he ever got started to it, because
he’s the Company man. He threw them things
away, so I reckon ye’ll be welcome to ‘em.”</p>

<p>Joslin took these articles and looked them over. To
put on another man’s clothing was to him the hardest
trial of all his life. Proud as the proudest of aristocrats,
it cut him to the core to use these things thus
offered. Concluding that it was his duty, he accepted
it with the other punishments which life was offering
him.</p>

<p>“Thank ye, ma’am,” said he. “They’ll come right
handy, I’m sure.” He did not smile as he spoke.</p>

<p>As for the Widow Dunham, she herself did smile,
as he went out the gate. “Hit’ll be right good to have
a man around the house onct more,” said she to herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>This was of a morning. As dusk fell, Joslin appeared
once more at the door of his new home. He
was not left long idle.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell ye, Mister,” said the widow, “I ain’t axin
no questions about how ye come here&mdash;I’m mountain
myself, an’ I kin keep my mouth shet. If ye’ll fetch
me some worter from the well yander, an’ go down to
the river an’ git me some slabs fer the fire, an’ saw ‘em
up, I’ll be obleeged to ye. Then ye’ll have yore supper.
How ye beginnin’ to feel now?” She turned her
glance to the wound in the back of Joslin’s head.</p>

<p>He made no answer, but accepted the pail which
she handed him, and presently brought in the water.
He never in his life had taken orders from a man, far
less from a woman, and no duties could have been
harder for him than these menial ones of the household.</p>

<p>About the second portion of his errand, Joslin went
to the slab pile, which lay above the saw mill near the
boat landing, which itself was about a half a mile
above the last of the locks of the Kentucky River. As
he rose, having gathered his armful of bits of sound
pieces for firewood, he heard the chug of a power
boat, so unusual a thing in that part of the world that
for a time he stood motionless, looking at the craft as
it approached. It was a river skiff, driven by an ouboard
motor, the latter operated by a stranger, perhaps
a hand from some garage in a downstream town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The other occupants of the craft might at a glance
be seen to be “furrin,” as the local phrase would go.
A stout, middle-aged man, florid of face, exceedingly
well clad, immaculate as to collar, cuffs and shirt
bosom, sat in the bow, looking anxiously ahead. Midships
was a yet more extraordinary figure for that locality&mdash;a
young woman, perhaps twenty-four or
twenty-five years of age, nicely turned out in tailor-made
traveling suit, and wearing gloves, apparel unheard
of for a woman in the mountains. Of extremely
beautiful face was she, with large, somber gray eyes,
defined strongly by the dark brows above them, and a
mouth of exceeding sweetness, which softened the
grave repose of her features. Withal, a figure of striking
comeliness and grace for any surroundings, she
was a miracle, an apparition, here in this rude hill
town. Joslin had never seen her like nor dreamed it
She was a creature of another world.</p>

<p>It bid fair to be a clumsy landing on the part of the
steersman, who seemed none too well accustomed to
his task. “Damn it! Look out!” irritably called the
man in the bow. “You’ll have us over yet. Lend a
hand there, can’t you?”</p>

<p>His last remark was addressed to Joslin, who without
noting the imperative nature of the words, at once
dropped his armful of slabs, and hurried to the edge
of the wharf, steadying the bow of the boat as it came
in. He made fast the painter at a projecting bit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the wharf floor, and went so far as to steady the
stranger by the arm, as he clumsily stepped out from
the boat. The latter himself gave a hand to the other
passenger.</p>

<p>“Well, here we are, Marcia,” said he; “end of the
world, anyway as far as I’ve been myself before. So
we’re even at that, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Well, stranger,” said he, turning once more to Joslin,
“who are you?”</p>

<p>Joslin knew that he was meeting none other than
the “quality folks,” Mr. and Mrs. Haddon of New
York&mdash;the man whose coat and shoes he was at that
time wearing. But with his genius at reticence, he
made no comment..</p>

<p>“I jest come down from the Widow Dunham’s to
git a little firewood,” said he. “Kin I hep ye up with
any of yore things, ma’am?”</p>

<p>The strangely beautiful young woman stood looking
at him gravely and unsmilingly, yet kindly. Instinctively,
he recognized the soul of a real gentlewoman.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said she to him now. “There are
some things there”&mdash;she hesitated, as she turned toward
the boat.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, ma’am. I’ll fetch up a bunch of
‘em when I come.”</p>

<p>So he turned to these additional duties, so foreign
to his life and taste; but suddenly it seemed to him that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
just in return for that gaze of hers, not critical, not
appraising him as some wild creature, not twitting him
or degrading him, he would be willing to do almost
anything in the world.</p>

<p>The newcomers were welcomed most effusively by
the Widow Dunham herself, who escorted them into
the best room of the house, and dusted off all the chairs
with her apron, talking meanwhile volubly, and assuring
them of her great delight at seeing them.</p>

<p>“Ye’ll like it here, Ma’am, onct ye git used to it.
I know yore husband right well&mdash;he was here last
year. Air ye going back into the hills with him?”</p>

<p>“I think we are not quite sure about that yet,” replied
Mrs. Haddon. “It’s very pleasant here, and I’m
very tired. Do you suppose, Jim,” said she, turning
to her husband, “we could rest here for a while? It’s
very beautiful here, and I feel I’m going to be comfortable.”</p>

<p>“That’s how we try to make everybody feel,” said
the Widow Dunham. As she spoke to the woman, her
eyes were upon the man. She was what was sometimes
termed by her neighbors a marrying woman, and
all men, married or single, she estimated with a keen
eye and one experienced.</p>

<p>Haddon laughed a gusty laugh. “We’re fifty miles
short of the real Cumberlands here, Marcia. Our
property runs from thirty to fifty or even sixty miles
back in. To tell the truth, I haven’t seen any of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
lands, although we’ve got more than a million invested
in here.”</p>

<p>“There’s a power of land been bought&mdash;timber an’
coal rights&mdash;for the last twenty year,” assented the
Widow Dunham. “Now they do tell me that they’re
a-findin’ oil on some of that land up in yander. No
tellin’ what’ll happen. There’s even talk maybe there’ll
be a railroad up Hell-fer-Sartin one of these days afore
long.”</p>

<p>“Who told you about these things?” inquired the
newcomer with a certain asperity. “Don’t let it get
out&mdash;don’t talk about anything. By the way, I’ve got
to get some sort of guide&mdash;some man who knows that
country, and will take me in. Know of anybody?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know, Mr. Haddon,” replied the
widow ruminatingly, “who ye could git to take ye
in. There’s a young man I got around the house&mdash;he
just come out.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean the chap that was down at the
boat-landing, do you? He’s out in the yard now.”</p>

<p>The Widow Dunham nodded contemplatively.
“Yes. His name’s David Joslin. Folks here knows
the Joslins. He’s a mounting man&mdash;borned an’ bred
up in there, fifty mile or so. He’s one of the best
raft steersmen on this river&mdash;been right wild in his
time, but he ain’t a-skeered of nothin’. That’s the
name he’s got in these mountings. Maybe ye’d better
ax him. He’s a-workin’ down to the brick yard now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
an’ tell I give him yore old coat an’ shoes he didn’t
have a stitch of clothes to his name, so to speak. He
orter be willin’ to go to hell for a dollar a day, an’ I
reckon he would.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it’ll be a hell of a trip up in there,”
said Haddon in reply. “What do you think, Marcia?”</p>

<p>But Marcia Haddon neither then nor at any later
time, while partaking of the rude fare of the place,
made any comment or expressed any discontent.</p>

<p>When they had finished their evening meal, Haddon
led his wife out to the scanty gallery of the Widow
Dunham’s home, which, fenced off only by a broken
paling against the street, looked out toward the western
prospect of the hills. It was starlight now; the last
glow of the sinking sun had disappeared. Here and
there the slow sounds of the village life, now about
to adjust itself to sleep, came to their ears. The fragrance
of Haddon’s fine cigar hung heavy in the air.
They sat in silence. Haddon himself spoke more often
to others than to his wife, so it would appear, and as
for her, she was reticent by instinct. Her hands folded
in her lap, she sat without comment, looking out toward
the shadowy outline of the mountains which
crowded down to the river.</p>

<p>At length Haddon rose and stepped back into the
house, where he found the Widow Dunham standing
in the hall in converse with the tall young mountaineer.</p>

<p>“Now, now, Amy,” said he, advancing boldly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
chucking the comely dame under the chin, “no visiting
with anybody else but me, you understand&mdash;you
haven’t forgotten your old friend, have you?”</p>

<p>Joslin stepped back, somewhat astounded at this
familiarity on the part of the stranger, but the latter
only laughed in his face.</p>

<p>“Come along, young man,” said he. “Come out on
the porch. I want to talk to you for a while.”</p>

<p>Joslin silently followed him out, and stood leaning
against the rail of the gallery, as Haddon seated himself
and began to explain what he had in his mind.</p>

<p>“See here, young man,” said he. “They tell me
you’re from back in these mountains.”</p>

<p>“I was born thar,” said Joslin quietly.</p>

<p>“How’d you happen to come out here?” demanded
the newcomer.</p>

<p>“I don’t reckon it’s ary man’s business but my own,”
replied Joslin calmly.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re going back in, aren’t you, after a
while?”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t planned ter,” said the young man. “I
come out because I wanted ter. I’m a-goin’ on Outside
because I think I’d orter. I’ve got to work. What I
want is a chancet.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve got a chance for you.”</p>

<p>“How do ye mean, stranger?”</p>

<p>“Near as I can tell, you’re the very man I’m looking
for. I’m the manager and vice-president of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
land company that’s been buying stuff up in here for
the last twenty years. We’ve got big holdings up in
there&mdash;on the Laurel and Newfound, and the Rattlesnake
and Buffalo, and Big Creek and Hell-fer-Sartan&mdash;we’ve
got timber or coal or both located all
through there. Now, listen&mdash;I’m in here now because
there’s talk of oil being found in there. Do you know
anything about that?”</p>

<p>“They said they found some along some of the
creeks not fur from whar I lived at.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever heard anything about the railroad?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was huntin’ on Hell-fer-Sartin not more’n
two months ago, an’ I seen the stakes. There hain’t
no other way they kin git through but only jest that
one.”</p>

<p>“What is there in the way of moonshining going on
in there? Any danger for an outsider to go in
there?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know nothin’ at all about that,” said David
Joslin. “If I did I wouldn’t tell ye.”</p>

<p>Haddon sat frowning in silence for quite a while.
“You’re a funny lot, you mountain people,” said he.
“It’s hard to do business with you.”</p>

<p>“Some ways it mought be hard with me,” replied
Joslin.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you need the money that I could pay
you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s nobody in the world needs money more’n
I do. But I tolt ye I was headed the other way.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you go back in if I pay you the right
wages?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m headed the other way.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, listen,” said Haddon irritably. “I need
some native that knows those damned people. They
tell me there’s no such thing as roads, and you have to
ride horseback or muleback wherever you want to go.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” replied the mountain man. “That’s
the onliest way. There hain’t no sich thing as towns.
Ye’d have to stop at the cabins. Ary man’s welcome in
there if they think he’s all right, an’ hain’t a-lookin’
fer nothin’ er nobody.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ho!” said Haddon, nodding understandingly.
“Some trouble in there, eh? Well, I suppose you’ve
seen your share of it.” He grinned, as he looked at
Joslin’s head, where he had already noted the wound
still unhealed.</p>

<p>“We don’t say nothin’ about sich matters in these
hills, stranger,” said Joslin quietly. “I’m a-tellin’ ye
if I went in thar with ye, ye’d be all right. But I
hain’t a-goin’. Ye kain’t noways hire me.”</p>

<p>“You’re pretty danged independent,” rejoined Haddon
testily. “The woman here just told me that you’re
wearing my coat and my shoes right now. You must
be hard up against it. Probably you were run out
of these hills, and that’s why you want to get outside.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
And now I offer you fair pay&mdash;good pay, in fact&mdash;five
dollars a day, or ten&mdash;just to go in and show me the
timber and coal in that country, which you don’t own
but we own&mdash;and you say you won’t go. Is that the
way you treat a stranger?”</p>

<p>“Hit mought be the way to treat some strangers. As
fer yore shoes an’ coat, ye needn’t say I’m a-wearin’
‘em no longer.” And so, deliberately, Joslin removed
both the shoes and the coat, and stood coatless and
barefooted, leaning against the gallery rail. He felt
with a certain mortification the straight gaze of the
young woman who had sat listening quietly. She spoke
now.</p>

<p>“Mr. Joslin,” said she in the low and even tones
usual for her speaking voice, “I think you need those
things. I quite understand how you feel about wearing
them, but you will oblige me very much by keeping
them until you are able to earn something better.”</p>

<p>David Joslin, the shame, humiliation and hot anger
of his heart struggling for mastery, turned to her, for
the moment unable to speak. Then, silently as he had
removed the offending articles, he replaced them.</p>

<p>“I thank ye, Ma’am,” said he. “I reckon ye know
better’n I do what I’d orter do.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said she, turning toward him in the
twilight a face that to him had the charm of an angel’s,
“my husband wants you to go back in there with him.
Why is it impossible?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hit’s impossible, Ma’am, because when I make up
my mind to a thing it’s impossible to change it.”</p>

<p>She sat looking at him curiously. Never in all
her life had she seen a personality more powerful than
that of this half-wild heathen who stood before her.
The feel of the iron of his soul came upon her with
strange effect.</p>

<p>“I’ll not ask you why you’re going outside,” said
she, after a moment.</p>

<p>“Jest because ye don’t ax me, I’ll tell ye,” said
Joslin suddenly. “I’m a-goin’ outside to git a education.”</p>

<p>“An education? There aren’t many schools back
in there?”</p>

<p>“Thar hain’t no schools at all, Ma’am. My daddy
war a preacher afore he died. I kain’t read in no
book to amount to nothin’. I kain’t hardly write my
own name. I’m a-goin’ outside to git a education,
because I’m a-goin’ to build a college, Ma’am.”</p>

<p>“A college!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Ma’am. I’ve got to do it. My people have
been a-killin’ each other in thar fer a hundred years.
They kain’t read, they kain’t write, they kain’t think.
They hain’t amountin’ to nothin’ whatever in the
world. They’re a great people, Ma’am. They’re worth
savin’. Well, it kind of come to me, in a sort of callin’,
that I’d orter save them. So, like I said, I’m a-goin’
Outside to git me a education, soon as I kin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>The situation had suddenly become extraordinary.
They waited for the mountaineer to go on, as presently
he did.</p>

<p>“I’ve nuvver been further down the river than a
couple of locks below. I’ve rafted here sence I was
fourteen year old, but beyant the aidge of the hills I
don’t know nothin’ of the world. Kin ye tell me whar
I kin git my education? I don’t reckon it’ll take long&mdash;us
mounting people larn right fast, Ma’am, when
we git a chancet.”</p>

<p>Then, after a pause, he went on, anxiously: “I’d
do arything in the world to obleege ye, Ma’am&mdash;I’d
go back in thar right now with ye if I had time. But
ye see, I’m twenty-eight year old, an’ I hain’t got no
time to lose.”</p>

<p>Marcia Haddon sat in silence for a time and looked
at her husband, who, moody and irritated, was flicking
at the end of his cigar.</p>

<p>“This is rather an extraordinary thing, Jim,” said
she. “Do you suppose&mdash;is there any way we could
help this man?”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t seem any too willing to help us,” replied
Haddon grimly.</p>

<p>“I hain’t said that, Mister,” said Joslin evenly. “I’d
do arything in the world I could fer ye people if it
was right.”</p>

<p>Haddon gave a snort of laughter. “You people in
here haven’t got a thing in the world&mdash;we bring in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the money you’ll ever see. You’ve got your resources
to sell, and you aren’t willing to sell them. Well,
what do we owe you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know as ye owe us anything,” said David
Joslin, the slow color rising to his face. “As fer me,
I don’t allow to owe ary man arything very long. I
reckon ye understand that, Ma’am.”</p>

<p>He turned now to the woman, who nodded. He
knew that she did understand.</p>

<p>“Is there anybody else that you can get to take us
in there?” demanded Haddon impatiently. “Damn it
all, I’ve almost a notion to turn around and go back
again! For half a cent I’d advise the boys to charge
off the whole damn thing to profit and loss. I’m
sore&mdash;that’s what I am.”</p>

<p>The low voice of Marcia Haddon began once more,
and as before she addressed not her husband, but the
young mountain man.</p>

<p>“You spoke about going in at some later time,” said
she. “You interest me. My husband and I have no
children. I’d like to do something&mdash;something for
those children back there in the hills.”</p>

<p>“Ma’am,” said David Joslin, his voice trembling,
“if ye could do that God A’mighty shore would nuvver
fergit it, not whiles He had a universe to run. If ye
could do that&mdash;I’d do arything in the world fer
ye.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, come,” said Haddon, still argumentatively.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
“You say you don’t know anyone else that you
can get to take me in there?”</p>

<p>“I don’t, sir. The Gannts an’ the Joslins is both
a-ridin’ now. Thar’s been men killed, an’ goin’ to be
more killed. If ary stranger went in thar, he’d be
liable nuvver to come out at all.”</p>

<p>“Well,” rejoined Haddon, “I don’t think my salary
will warrant my going in there and getting shot up by
some long-legged son-of-a-gun toting a squirrel rifle.
That doesn’t appeal to me any whatever. Listen,
man!” Haddon sat up suddenly in his chair as an idea
flashed upon his keen business brain. “Listen now,”
and he extended an arresting forefinger. “I’ll tell you
what I’ll do with you. You know that country and
I don’t. I’ll pay you ten dollars a day and all your
expenses to New York if you’ll go back with me. I
want you to address a meeting of my company and
some other companies that are in the business. That’ll
do just as well, if you tell a good straight story, as if
I went in there myself. You do know the country,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I know it day an’ night, through an’ through. I
know every coal seam in them hills. I know most
every old-time poplar tree an’ big white oak from
Hell-fer-Sartin to the mouth of Rattlesnake, an’ from
Big Creek to the Main Forks. I don’t know nothin’
else.”</p>

<p>“Now then&mdash;now then&mdash;now then,” resumed Haddon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
excitedly&mdash;“that’s the answer! That certainly is
the answer to the whole thing. Now, you come back
with us&mdash;I’ll get you some clothes, and that sort of
thing, of course. I’ll pay your railroad fare and expenses,
and ten dollars a day, and I’ll keep you in New
York until this business is over. In return for that,
all I want you to do is to tell my men what you know
about that country&mdash;how many trees there are to an
acre on that Hell-fer-Sartin tract&mdash;where the oil croppings
are, so far as you know&mdash;where the railroad’s
got to come. Can you show it on a map?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about maps, stranger,” said David
Joslin, “but if ye could tell me the names of the places
on the maps, like rivers, ye know&mdash;ye see, I kain’t read
very well, not yit.”</p>

<p>“Sure, sure, I’ll fix that all right I’ll show it for
you just like a book. A child could read it.”</p>

<p>“I kain’t read no better’n a child, Mr. Haddon, but
if ye kin show me whar the creeks is marked on the
map I kin show ye whar the railroad has got to go.
I kin put my finger on every place whar oil has been
found, er gas&mdash;ye know, thar’s places whar gas has
been burnin’ fer forty year, ever sence the War, an’
thar didn’t nobody know about it.”</p>

<p>“There doesn’t anyone know that there’s a continuance
of the big West Virginia anticline right through
these mountains,” rejoined Haddon grimly. “Oil?&mdash;There’s
got to be oil in here, and I know it. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
geologists figured that all out before you ever told me
there had been oil found in here. Why, man&mdash;I can’t
afford <i>not</i> to take you back with me. And you can’t
afford not to come.”</p>

<p>“What do ye think of this, Ma’am?” said David
Joslin, turning toward the quiet young woman. “I
reckon ye mought be ashamed of me if I went along
with ye.” He flushed dully.</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Joslin,” said she, quickly. “You’ll learn.
You wouldn’t be unhappy, I think. I want you to feel
that we want to help you. Let my husband take care
of the business part. I’ll see what I can do toward
getting you a chance to study. If money is good for
anything, Jim, it ought to be good for just some such
thing as this.”</p>

<p>“Is it a trade, man?” said the Northerner suddenly.</p>

<p>“I believe I’ll go with ye, Ma’am,” said David Joslin
quietly for his reply. He did not speak to the man.</p>

<p>It was a trade! When Jimmy Haddon stepped back
once more into the house, to the side of the table where
the flickering oil lamp stood, he caught the Widow
Dunham gaily about the shoulders, chucked her under
the chin once more, and kissed her fair on the lips. It
chanced he did this just as his wife came into the hall,
so that she saw the whole transaction. She made no
comment. She also had made her trade, years ago,
when she married. If she had lost, she would not yet
complain. But Joslin saw the hot flush on her cheek.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="pch">POLLY PENDLETON</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">“WELL, Marcia, here we are,” said James
Haddon, as at last their long railway journey
drew to its close in the swift sweep of
the train up the gates of the great city by the sea.
“Better begin to round up your wild man&mdash;I saw him
standing in the vestibule looking out of the window as
though he was in a trance. What are we going to do
with him, now we’ve got him?”</p>

<p>“We’ll take him with us to our home, of course, Jim.
He’d be lost anywhere else. He knows no more than a
child.”</p>

<p>“Pretty husky child, some ways,” said Haddon.
“Well, all right, all right! I suppose you’re glad he’s
different from me. You don’t seem to have a lot of
use for me any more, some way&mdash;you’ve been like a
clam ever since we left New York, and you’re more
like a clam now that we’re getting back. There’s worse
fellows in the world than Jimmy Haddon, and maybe
you’ll live to see it yet. I’ll show you, if this deal
goes through&mdash;and it will if your wild friend makes
good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“But now here we are getting into the tube&mdash;I’d
better catch the wild man, or he may get scared and
jump off the train. All right&mdash;we’ll take him up
home.”</p>

<p>The rushing whirl of the city received them&mdash;the
city, a place occupied, so it seemed to this stranger,
with sad-faced madmen hurrying here and yon without
purpose. Mad&mdash;mad&mdash;hopelessly mad&mdash;so it all
seemed to David Joslin as, himself frightened with
the noise, the clamorings, the uncertainty of it all, he
finally emerged from the gates of the railway station
and stood close to the side of the woman who now
made his main reliance in this new world of the great
Outside.</p>

<p>A deferential man in livery came toward them and
led them to a long, shining limousine car which stood
at the curb. A moment later they were whirling away
through the crowded streets, escaping death every
instant, so it seemed to the newcomer, by the miracle
of a second’s fraction. He held his peace, as he had
now for five days in a new, mad world of which he
had not dreamed. They passed on out through the
crowded traffic street until they reached paved ways
leading to the north, and so, after a long and steady
flight of the car, drew up at the entrance of a great
apartment building on the river drive.</p>

<p>Joslin followed in. He never in his life before had
been in a passenger elevator. He felt a strange sinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
at the pit of his stomach, and caught instinctively at
the bars of the gate. He was still less at ease when
they led him into the silent and dim apartments where
Haddon and his wife lived, as luxurious as any of the
Riverside, the rent of which each month was more than
any farm in all the Cumberlands would bring in a year.</p>

<p>But Joslin was now in the home of a gentlewoman.
Quietly she took him in hand, relieving his embarrassment,
setting him at his ease, showing him where he
might live, and telling him kindly what might be expected
of him. He looked about him at his own room
with awe. These furnishings to him were so unbelievably
luxurious that he dared not sit down upon a
chair. He gazed upon the bed, with its yellow coverlet
of silk, with but one resolve&mdash;he would sleep upon
the floor, but never venture further&mdash;nor did he. And
when presently they called him to table he felt his
heart sink yet further in these strange surroundings,
so that he could not eat. He had accosted as “Mister”
the servant who went to his room with him&mdash;he saw
the same man now, and wondered that he stood, and
did not eat with the others&mdash;wondered that no one
noticed him nor the white-capped maid who passed.
Surely it was all a strange, mad world.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Haddon, after his hurried finishing of
his own meal, “I’ve got to get down to the little
old shop right away, Marcia. They’ll not be expecting
me, of course, but it’s a good piece of business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
that I’m back when I am, and just the way I am.”</p>

<p>“I presume you’ll have plenty to do,” commented his
wife.</p>

<p>“Listen! I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’m going to
get together all the directors of the Company, and
we’ll pull off a little dinner at the Williston&mdash;in the
Gold Room. How’ll that do, my Christian friend?”
said he, grinning at Joslin as he stepped to the hall
table and picked up his own hat and gloves.</p>

<p>“Of course, I can’t do that right away,” he continued,
turning back, his stick over his arm, his well-brushed
hat now on his head. “Maybe a couple of
days. I’ll be busy. Maybe I’ll have to stay down at
the club to-night, Marcia. I’ll check up about dinner
time.”</p>

<p>He did not call up at about dinner time, nor at all
until past noon the next day, when he explained that
he had been crowded at the office and unable to get
his own apartments by phone&mdash;explanations with which
his wife was fairly familiar.</p>

<p>As for Joslin, he passed the two days in what seemed
to him a continual kaleidoscope of madhouse change.
Now in charge of one of the chauffeurs, sometimes in
the more gracious company of his hostess, he spun up
and down the streets of the great city, looking at the
untold thousands of its inhabitants, wondering at its
stately buildings, wondering at the beauty of its parks,
so like and yet so unlike the woods he had always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
known. In the evening, in his own room, he read
steadily, as best he might, spelling out the complex,
stern theology of old John Calvin. Now and again he
raised his eyes and wondered what Calvin would have
done had he been here.</p>

<p>They brought to him now certain other clothing
of Jimmy Haddon’s, a trifle short, a trifle large, but
serving better than anything he yet had had. He was
not happy in all this&mdash;no man ever was more unhappy
in all his life than David Joslin now. Moreover,
there came to his heart, every moment of the day and
night, the most exquisite of pain&mdash;nostalgia&mdash;the
actual illness of homesickness. He longed unspeakably
for the sight of the mountains, for the smell of
the wood-smoke of the fires, the look of the stars at
night, the pink of the dawn when morning came. Life
here was a fearsome thing, and long and hard seemed
the unknown road that lay before him.</p>

<p>Haddon came home after his second night away and
announced that all was in readiness for the great banquet
of the men whom he represented in his business
affiliations.</p>

<p>“I’m going to give you your first chance in public
speaking now, Joslin,” said he. “Believe me, you’ll
have an attentive audience for once, if you never do
again&mdash;weren’t you talking of being a preacher, or
something? Talk business, son, straight business&mdash;that’s
all we want to hear. If you make good, you’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
have the time of your life. Help us, and we’ll help
you&mdash;see?”</p>

<p>“How about clothes?” He turned questioningly to
his wife, who was in the room at the time. “Of course
it’s evening dress&mdash;is there a spare suit of mine around
anywhere?”</p>

<p>Marcia Haddon looked at the two for a moment
“Perhaps Mr. Joslin would not prefer it,” said she.</p>

<p>Joslin shook his head. “No,” said he. “I hain’t
a-goin’ to change from these clothes I’ve got on now.
I’m used to ‘em a little.”</p>

<p>Haddon’s companion, therefore&mdash;and Haddon rather
prided himself on his invariably well-groomed appearance&mdash;presented
something of a noticeable turn-out
when they entered the lobby of the great hotel where
the banquet was to be, but he did not notice the apologetic
grimaces Haddon gave in response to certain
lifted eyebrows of his friends whom he met here and
there.</p>

<p>“Well, come along, old man,” said he to his guest,
at length. “We’ll leave our coats and hats here, and
go and see if we can find some more of the fellows.”</p>

<p>He was not at a loss as to the place of search. The
long glazed and marbled bar of the Williston at that
time was thronged with hundreds, much athirst. Behind
the vast reaches of mahogany stood many bartenders,
all busy. Men in evening dress, with top hats
and beautifully fitting evening wear, men impeccable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
in gloves and glasses and fit for presentation in any
city of the world&mdash;stood here, laughing, talking, jesting,
drinking. One after another all these now accosted
Haddon, some with a sly word, a glance, a hint,
a jest&mdash;things which he hushed down as soon as might
be, for he knew the keen suspicion of the mountaineer.</p>

<p>“Well, what are you going to have to drink?” said
he to Joslin at length, edging his own way up to the
bar. “We’ve got to lay some sort of a foundation for
the dinner, you know. What kind of cocktail do you
want&mdash;Martini?”</p>

<p>“I never did drink nothin’ but plain corn liquor,”
said Joslin. “If I could have jest a leetle of that now,
maybe&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Have a cocktail. It’s too early for
hard liquor yet. Make him another, John,” and he
nodded to the bartender.</p>

<p>Joslin raised the little glass, whose contents seemed,
in color at least, not unfamiliar to him as a mountain
man, but he drank no more than half of the contents,
and then set down the glass. It was his first and only
cocktail. He made no comment as his host urged him,
but moved away from the bar. Haddon himself remained
to finish two or three more of the insidious
potions before he himself turned and with the others
began to move toward the quarters set apart for the
banquet party.</p>

<p>By this time the crowd was much like the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
male banquet crowd&mdash;a trifle flushed of face, a trifle
garrulous of tongue, each in his own heart happy, and
each in his own belief quite witty and very much
aplomb. They were seated in due course at the long
tables arranged after the fashion of a Maltese cross.
Haddon, it seemed, was to preside. He placed his
guest at his own right, in the place of honor.</p>

<p>“Trust little old Jimmy to pull a thing off,” said one
merchant to another. “He never went down to that
country for nothing. He’s got the goods with him,
and you can gamble on that. He told me himself how
he caught this wild mountain man and brought him on
to talk to us to-night. He knows every foot of the land
in there, and he can tell us the whole works. Coal&mdash;gas&mdash;oil&mdash;those
lands of ours are full of it! Looks
like we were going to make a killing. Trust Jimmy.
He’s one grand little live wire, if we’ve got one in our
village.”</p>

<p>The dinner wore on, much as these things usually
run&mdash;the original stage of hilarity somewhat modified
under the sobering influence of food. It was all
strange to Joslin, who, so it seemed to him, scarcely
had one plate set before him before it was taken away
and replaced by yet another. Few noticed what he did.</p>

<p>Presently, when all were well forward with coffee
and cigars, Haddon rapped loudly on the table as he
rose. A change came over the entire personnel of
the assemblage. Here but now had been a riotous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
meeting of full-blooded men, young men, middle-aged
men, gray-haired men, bent on nothing better than
drinking and eating. But now anyone who glanced
down these tables would have seen a steady keenness,
a fixity of purpose, on the face of practically every
man present. They were hard-headed American business
men on the instant now, each man ready for the
purpose which really had brought him here. Money&mdash;the
pursuit of money&mdash;the keen zest of the game of
business&mdash;that was the real intoxication of these men,
and not that of alcohol. They listened now in perfect
silence to what their representative might have to say.</p>

<p>Haddon told them briefly something of his late trip
into the Cumberlands, told why it had been ended so
abruptly for a second time, admitted that he had never
been over much of the Company’s land holdings, in
the mountains, and explained the reasons why that was
a difficult thing. He showed that it was necessary to
have a guide to make a successful exploration of the
properties in that country, and adverted to the benefits
of direct testimony rather than hearsay, explaining
how he had brought this mountaineer, who had spent
all his life in the middle of the Company’s properties,
to the city with him to tell them his own first-hand
story of the land.</p>

<p>A large map hung on the wall, and to this he adverted
from time to time. Joslin’s eyes followed him.
Yes, he knew these streams&mdash;he could locate this or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
that territory familiar to himself, here on the map.
He knew on the ground what Haddon pointed out
upon the map. So presently, when they called upon
him to speak, he rose with no great diffidence on his
own part.</p>

<p>They greeted him with a generous round of applause,
which startled him, for he had never heard
anything of the sort. But after all David Joslin was
a man of great dignity and self-respect, with great
powers of mind as well as of body. And there lurked
somewhere within him, as in so many of these strong
characters of the hills, natural instincts of the orator.</p>

<p>He spoke strongly, simply, powerfully, with no attempt
at embellishment, but in such terms as left no
doubt whatsoever as to his meaning. After a time he
stepped to the map, and, pointing out here and there,
explained as nearly as he himself knew the nature of
the Company’s holdings. He told them where the coal
cropped out at the headwaters of this or that creek, told
them that on some of the mountain sides three veins
of coal had been known ever since he could remember,
the middle vein over eight feet thick, the lower four
feet thick, and that nearest to the mountain top almost
as deep. He explained to them that there was coal
over more than a hundred miles of that country, as
he knew, and told them how nearly everyone mined
his own coal on his own land, and did not trouble to
cut wood for much of the year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>As for the new strikes of oil, Joslin could put his
finger upon the map where every one of these discoveries
had been made. He said that his own people
cared little for that, for they had long grown to believe
there was no way for them to get out into the
world. He explained to them that there were no
roads in that country, that logs were dragged down
the mountain side by cattle, rolled into the shallow
streams by hand labor, and left to the chance of the
infrequent “tides.” He told them that in many of
those streams there were logs enough to touch end
to end from one end of the creek to the other&mdash;logs
enough bedded in the sand to floor the creek entirely
for half its length&mdash;black walnut logs two and a half
feet through&mdash;white oak logs three and a half feet
in diameter&mdash;and poplar four and a half feet. Their
eyes glistened as he went on telling all these things
naturally, simply, naively, as one fully acquainted
with them. He explained to them the ways of all
these methods of logging, how no one could run a
saw mill in that region with profit, how no raftsman
ever made more than a living at his work, hard as it
was. Then he told them how he himself had seen the
stakes of the new railroad line coming across the
head of Hell-fer-Sartin and making for the upper
waters of Big Creek, and passing thence on to the older
railway lines.</p>

<p>“When the railroad comes, gentle-<i>men</i>,” said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
“things has got to change in thar. We’ve been alone&mdash;no
one knows much about our lands. Ye come in
thar twenty years ago, when no one cared for nothin’.
Ye bought yore land fer skercely a dollar a acre,
most of it, an’ thar’s trees on it thar that’s wuth ten
an’ twenty dollars fer every log in ‘em, onct ye git
‘em out, an’ two, three, four logs to the tree. The
railroad will let the world in, an’ it’ll let us out. I
reckon the time has come fer that. All I ask ye in
turn fer what I’m a-tellin’ ye, is to treat my people
fair. Give them a fair value fer what they’ve got.
They’re pore, they’re ignerint, they’re blind. I’m as
ignerint as the wust of ‘em. But we’re squar’ with
ye. We want ye to be squar’ with us.”</p>

<p>A blank silence greeted this last remark. Men
looked from one to the other. Once in a while there
might have been a cynical smile or sneer that passed.
After he had spoken for an hour, perhaps more than
an hour, and had answered all such questions as they
asked him, David Joslin sat down. A voice in the back
part of the room arose.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Jimmy Haddon?”</p>

<p>A vociferous chorus answered. Joslin did not understand
the methods of these men, but vaguely he
gathered that what he had said had been well received.</p>

<p>On the whole he felt content. Now, he said to himself,
on the very next day he would go about his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
business. He would leave this place, which confused
him so much. He was done with the city now. He
had done his duty.</p>

<p>But this did not by any means close the entertainment
of the evening as these men conceived it. As
they had been revelers and again business men, so now
once more they laid aside the habit of affairs and
turned again to the business of banqueting. Waiters
came quickly and filled up glasses, large glasses, with
bubbling wine. Again mingling voices arose, laughter,
jests. The glasses were filled again, and yet again.
The business of the day was over. Joy was to be more
unconfined.</p>

<p>Men drew back curtains at the head of the hall,
revealing a little platform where stood a piano, which
was wheeled into place. At a signal from Haddon
there entered an orchestra of foreign sort, and they
mingled music and jangling discord of the usual kind,
perhaps among other things a melody or so of the
hour; for voices arose, and sounds of hands and feet
keeping time. A basso, very knock-kneed and small
of chin, appeared from some unknown region, sang a
solo, bowed and disappeared. A quartet of negro
singers furnished rather better entertainment, so it
seemed. And then men began to push back their
chairs, so that they might easily see the entrance of
the room.</p>

<p>All at once a round of general and vociferous applause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
arose. Jimmy Haddon arose and hastened to
greet the latest comers.</p>

<p>There stood in the doorway two young women,
dressed with a certain similarity, their long cloaks held
together by clasps, their arms in long white gloves.
There were two, but there might as well have
been but one, for the older of the concert team of
Pendleton and Stanton&mdash;Pollie Pendleton and Nina
Stanton, known in every theater of the land that
year&mdash;lacked so much of the charm of her companion
that she quite resigned herself to the amiable role of
foil.</p>

<p>They were young women of that sort known
in Babylon and Boston. Whence they come, who
shall say? Whither they go, who knows&mdash;the
young women of the world, the beloved and the forgotten.
The world has always had them, and
perhaps will always have them&mdash;young, splendidly
beautiful, splendidly alluring&mdash;who come from
none knows whence, and who go no one knows
whither.</p>

<p>The assembled males applauded when they saw
these two young women standing there&mdash;short of
skirt, low of slipper, low of gown. All but one rose
gaily to welcome them. One man sat transfixed.</p>

<p>There was revealed to David Joslin, in the person
of Polly Pendleton, such a vision as never had he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
known in all his life, a dream which he not yet had
dreamed, nor could have dreamed, so wholly outside
of all his possible experience must it have been called.
He never before had seen woman at her frank best in
sheer riot of the beauty of her sex. It awed him.</p>

<p>She was a woman, but scarce seemed that to him.
To his eyes she was not woman, but some supernal
thing, a Presence, a Being. And in the sheer fact
that she was of his genus, of his species, that she was
woman and he was man, he sat suddenly exalted, glorified
himself, superman&mdash;for now at last his eyes had
seen!</p>

<p>She smiled at them all in her swift and comradely
fashion, and stepped promptly toward the little platform.
Not a man there who did not know Polly
Pendleton of the Follies, the best-liked girl on the stage
that year. Singer, violinist, dancer&mdash;she had made her
way up by one or the other of her arts or all of them,
until now she might use all or either, as she liked.</p>

<p>A woman of about middle stature was Polly Pendleton,
of covetably slender and firm-set figure. Her
eyes were large and dark, with long lashes, her face a
strong, clean oval, her skin clear, her teeth brilliant,
her head a mass of short, dark curls. So much might
be said of many women, perhaps, but Polly Pendleton
had some strange plus charm of her own, that charm
for which managers pay any price. She seemed the
very spirit, the very embodiment of life, youth, eagerness&mdash;of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
vital joy itself. The thought of evil could
not touch her, so sweet and clean she seemed, in every
fiber of her being there was such life and such joy in
living. Her gestures were those of the young animal,
of the bird, careless, unstudied. She had no art, but
succeeded through her lack of art and through her own
zest, her sheer vitality.</p>

<p>When Polly Pendleton stood waiting for something,
interested in anything, keyed up, not even her feet
could rest upon the floor. She had a strange way sometimes,
even when talking to one, of dancing up and
down on her toes, light as a feather, her young limbs
seeming not to feel the weight of her body. There
seemed an ethereal air about her, as though she needed
not to walk, needed not to stand, unless she liked.</p>

<p>She stood now before them, having drawn from
beneath her coat her cherished violin, whose music
had pleased so many thousands. Obviously she intended
first to play. She laid aside her cloak and stood,
eager, interested, slightly leaning forward, anxious,
dancing up and down upon her little feet. Youth,
life, joy, vitality, freedom from care, absolute ignorance
and disregard of toil or trouble or anxiety&mdash;there
stood Polly Pendleton.</p>

<p>She laid the violin to her cheek and, her eyes now
aside and high, drew a strong, firm bow across the
strings. When she did this she drew out the heart
and soul from the body of David Joslin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>But David Joslin never really had heard the violin
before. Of actual music he knew nothing. He had
never heard a master of any instrument in all his life.
But the sound of the violin itself, last keen climax
in this atmosphere of exhilaration, where now the
young spirit of this one fragile girl commanded the
strong masculine spirit of all these massed men&mdash;for
David Joslin constituted an overwhelming experience.</p>

<p>She finished her number, and when the roar of applause
had ceased turned to her associate, who seated
herself at the piano. They both sang&mdash;one of their
duets; and as part of this Polly Pendleton herself
danced&mdash;whirling about in pirouettes where her toes
seemed scarce to find a footing, her round, strong
limbs insouciantly exposed. She was but the spirit of
youth, of life, of joy.</p>

<p>Now certain of the critical began to demand something
known earlier as especially delectable.</p>

<p>“Sing us the real one, Polly!” they cried. “Sing us
‘The Only Man,’ why don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes; that’s it&mdash;that’s it&mdash;give us ‘The Only Man,’
Polly;” and vigorous handclapping ensued.</p>

<p>She stood facing them again at the little raised dais,
her lips parted, her white teeth visible under her short,
smiling upper lip. She was always eager to please,
counting not the cost of herself&mdash;a rich and generous
soul indeed was hers. Not so much her fault as ours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
was it that she was here, one of the sacrifices, the
perishing imperishables of the world.</p>

<p>But Polly began to sing. The words matter little.
It was the chorus which had brought her fame. She
left the dais now, and advanced down the long table,
her whole face a-laugh. Her eyes were fixed on a
certain large, red-faced and very bald gentleman who
sat halfway down the table at the left. Him she approached,
singing as she came. She bent above him,
put an arm about his face, a hand under his chin, and
drew his head back as she bent above and sang to
him.</p>

<p>“For you are my Baby!” sang Polly Pendleton.
“You are my Baby! You’re the only, only, <i>only</i> man
for me.”</p>

<p>Roars of laughter greeted this. They sang in
chorus with her: “You’re the only, only, only man
for me!”</p>

<p>“Come here, Polly,” called this man and that. “This
way! You certainly are the only girl for me.”</p>

<p>But Polly Pendleton was back at the head of the
table once more, still singing, still light of foot, still
gay of song. She stood and faced them just for a
moment. Something she saw which seemed to arrest
her own attention&mdash;a grave, unsmiling face, with eyes
like coals, a white face which looked straight at
hers....</p>

<p>It was no more than a pace or two for Polly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
reach the head of the table, to push a hand out against
the raised one of Jimmy Haddon as he sat there flushed
and laughing. The next instant she had stopped, and
with the audacity of her very nature, so used to being
allowed its own freakish will, she passed an arm about
the head of David Joslin, a hand beneath his chin.
She drew his white face back, looked down into his
eyes, and sang&mdash;for a little while at least&mdash;“<i>You’re
the only, only, only man for me!</i>”</p>

<p>Something in the tense tableau they saw&mdash;some
note, undefinable, caused every man of that virile assemblage
to cease his laughter and applause. They
stared. They saw the great hands of the man close
tight about the white wrists of Polly Pendleton. She
ceased to stroke the strong hair of David Joslin, and
stood back, finishing her song out of touch and out of
tune. Some thought her voice quavered just a little.
But she sprang back tiptoe again upon the little dais,
and finished boldly&mdash;yes, and added thereto the notes
of her violin. None the less, there had been a scene.
Someone had not played the game. And they must
take care of Polly.</p>

<p>They broke into applause. Someone started to pass
a plate down the table. It was heaped up with money,
in great part yellow in color. Coins fell on the floor&mdash;but
there were no small silver ones. Some near by
flung money in the general direction of the little platform
where the two young women stood, smiling and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
bowing deeply&mdash;smiling at what they knew to be the
success of their little offerings that evening.</p>

<p>“Here you go, Polly!” as one man after another
cast toward her something folded. And Polly, grave
and a trifle white now, leaving her associate bowing
on the stage, passed down the aisle, met the heaped
plate on its way, stopped here and stopped there, laughing
and talking, chattering like some innocent child,
picking up money&mdash;money&mdash;more money than David
Joslin had thought there was in all the world. He
alone gave nothing, for he had naught to give&mdash;only
the happiness and peace of a human soul.</p>

<p>There was so much tribute that Polly made great
show of thrusting part of it beneath her garter, till
she could hold no more in that fashion. Some she
thrust into her bosom, and then, turning, carried the
rest of it to her partner, who happily was provided
with a reticule.</p>

<p>Everybody laughed&mdash;everybody was pleased. It
had cost them very little&mdash;perhaps a few hundred dollars&mdash;to
make these two girls feel that they had made
a hit. The wine was excellent. Everything had been
splendid in every way. The cost? Why, what Jimmy
Haddon had done for them in bringing this geezer here
to tell them about their property would bring them
more than ten thousand times the cost of the banquet,
or the cost of the whole investment.</p>

<p>And so, after a time, the banquet ended, very late&mdash;ended,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
indeed, when Polly Pendleton and her friend,
laughing and kissing their hands&mdash;Polly with her
violin tucked under her arm and her cloak over all&mdash;turned
once more to the door of the crystal and gold
room of the Williston banquet suite. Men rose and
waved serviettes at them, shouted good-by, asked them
to come again. Haddon himself walked with Polly
Pendleton to the door, kissed her hand, bowed goodnight.</p>

<p>As he turned back he saw standing, staring at him
fixedly, the tall, white-faced figure of the mountaineer,
whom he had utterly forgotten. The eyes of David
Joslin were like coals.</p>

<p>“Some girl, eh&mdash;what?” said Haddon admiringly
to his uncouth friend.</p>

<p>But Joslin made him no reply. What he had seen,
what he had felt that night, was epochal, abysmal for
him. He had looked into her eyes. He had seen her
face framed in her dark hair&mdash;had caught the very
fragrance of her hair itself. He was mad.</p>

<p>A motor car stood below, waiting for the popular
team of Pendleton and Stanton. It whirled them now
far uptown, to the little buffet flat which made their
home. Nina, matter-of-fact as usual, busied herself
about her preparations for the close of the day’s work.
But, singularly enough, Polly, usually riante and active
to the very last moment of the day, sat, cigarette in
hand, silent, somewhat triste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Polly?&mdash;Why don’t you get
ready?&mdash;I’m sleepy as an owl. What are you wolfing
about?”</p>

<p>“What makes you ask that, Nina?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s something.”</p>

<p>Silence for a time, and then Polly spoke. “How
do you think it went to-night, Nina?”</p>

<p>“Well, all I’ve got to say,” replied that worthy young
woman, “if it went this well about one or two more
nights a week or a month, we could retire and live
along the Sound like ladies the rest of our lives.”</p>

<p>“I wish it was all back,” said Polly Pendleton, somberly.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, the money.”</p>

<p>“Well, of all <i>things</i>!” exclaimed Nina Stanton,
staring at her partner. “What’s the matter with you,
Polly? Have you gone crazy? What’s set <i>you</i> thinking
this way? Of all <i>things</i>!”</p>

<p>“Well, it was that man, maybe. He mighty near
queered me. It’s always a man, you know&mdash;a girl
can’t get away from that.”</p>

<p>Nina still looked at her in wonderment. “You’re
out of your head, kid,” said she. “If anyone in little
old New York ought to be happy to-night, it’s you,
sitting right there grouching like you are. They didn’t
see me&mdash;I wasn’t there at all. You were the whole
works. I hate to take the money from you&mdash;and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
wouldn’t if I didn’t know you’d only spend it. I have
to watch you like a mother, kid.”</p>

<p>But Polly sat, shaking her head in somber discontent,
the little blue rings of her cigarette rising undisturbed
before her.</p>

<p>“Who was he, Nina?” she asked after a time.</p>

<p>“Who was who? The big bald-face guy down the
table?&mdash;that was Rankin of Rankin and Swan. He
acted like a good sport. As for Jimmy Haddon, he
must have chipped in fifty, anyways.”</p>

<p>But Polly was shaking her head from side to side.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, you mean the reuben at the head
of the table you were joshing. It was the hit of the
evening.”</p>

<p>“Was it, though?” said Polly vaguely.</p>

<p>“The hit of the evening, kid. That’s what brought
them across.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Polly, “it was a raw deal for him, I
suppose. Look here.” She held up her wrist. It
showed a blue line about it. “I never felt a man’s
hand like that in all my life. He could have broken
my arm if he’d wanted to.” She pushed a bracelet
reflectively up and down across the bruised ring which
the clutch of Joslin’s fingers had left upon her white
skin.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess he liked it all right,” commented Nina
casually. “They mostly do.”</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble,” rejoined Polly sagely. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
can’t tell how it was, but somehow that man made me
feel <i>ashamed</i>! There was something in his face&mdash;I
can’t tell you what. Ever since, I’ve been feeling as
if this money didn’t belong to us. I’ve a notion to
give you my share, Nina.”</p>

<p>“You can’t, kid. I’ve always been on the level with
you. I’ll take you over my knee and give you a spanking
now if you don’t shut up. You talk silly. An
ordinary hayseed from the hills&mdash;you better be thinking
of Rankin with his private yachts, or little old
Jimmy, your solid. You can’t complain. You’d better
be content with what you got.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Nina? I only say I feel sort
of ashamed. I never felt my skirts were short before
in all my life. I did then.”</p>

<p>Nina only turned with a short laugh as she stooped
to unfasten her own shoes in her progress towards her
night toilet. Polly arose and went to the panel where
protruded the handle of the wall bed which these two
loyal and thrifty partners occupied in common. She
pulled down the bed, went to the little wardrobe for
her own night robe, and, moodily silent, prepared herself
for sleep. At last she paused.</p>

<p>“Nina,” she said again, with a certain imperative
quality in her tone.</p>

<p>“What is it, kid?” demanded her good-humored
friend.</p>

<p>“You know what I think?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I don’t. I don’t think you think at all.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you. Sometimes I think I’ve had
about enough of this sort of thing. I’m sore on it. It
makes me sick. All those men&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But if it was the ‘only, only, <i>only</i> man’?” grinned
Nina.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” began Polly to herself&mdash;“I wonder
now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But what she wondered she did not vouchsafe. It
was some time later, in the darkness of the night, that
Nina felt a hand upon her arm, shaking her.</p>

<p>“What’s the idea, kid?” she said sleepily. “Can’t
you let a fellow sleep? I’m almost dead.”</p>

<p>“Nina, tell me!” demanded Polly, a strange earnestness
in her voice. “Am I bad? Nina&mdash;tell me&mdash;am I
as bad as that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up, kid,” said Nina, bored. “Go on to
sleep. There’s bats in your garret to-night, sure
thing.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="pch">MR. HADDON’S POINT OF VIEW</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">HADDON, puffy about the eyes, trembling of
fingers, sat at table the next day offering a
very fine example of the morning after organized
hilarity. The man opposed to him, haggard
and hollow-eyed, might have been suspected of indulgences
similar to those of his host, although such
would have been an unjust accusation.</p>

<p>Haddon found two stiff drinks of whisky needful
to attract his interest to his breakfast. Then he broke
the moody silence which had marked him.</p>

<p>“I say, old man,” he began, “you made a pretty fair
speech to the boys last night. We’re holding down
more than three hundred thousand acres of land in
the Cumberlands. We’re in deep, and some of the
fellows were getting cold feet until I brought you on
to tell them something about our holdings.”</p>

<p>Joslin sat looking at him in silence, and he went
on presently.</p>

<p>“You see, our money has been in there for twenty
years, some of it&mdash;that was long before I went into
the Company, of course. The holding of raw resources<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
is a waiting game&mdash;you cash in stiff after a
long wait. That’s what we’ve got to do now.</p>

<p>“But the way to handle this thing is to crowd when
the line begins to break. It’s time now for us to begin
to crowd. We’ve got to begin to cash in before long,
for the interest and taxes have been eating us up
long enough.</p>

<p>“Now, we need a good man down in there. The
boys have been sending me because they couldn’t do
any better. You and I between us know about how
much I know&mdash;we both know that you know a lot
more than I do. Now, you’ve been talking to me a
lot of rot about starting a college or a school, or something&mdash;I
don’t remember what all you were saying.
Forget it! Cut out all that business about saving
your country. Think a little bit about saving yourself.
This business of doing a whole lot for other
people is all right on paper, but when it comes down
to practical life there’s nothing in it. A fellow’s got
to think of <i>himself</i>.</p>

<p>“Now, what are you doing for yourself? You’re
sitting here in my house&mdash;not that I want to rub it in
by telling you so&mdash;in a suit of my clothes and a pair
of my shoes. You’re wearing my shirt and my socks
right now. You haven’t got a dollar of your own
money in your clothes to-day. You told me that you
had a wife and a grandmother. What are you
going to do about them? Any way you look, you’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
in a fine position to build a college! Why, hell!</p>

<p>“On the other hand, New York ain’t such a slow
village, is she? Pretty nice, eh? Something of a party
last night, what? Some girls, huh?</p>

<p>“Now, listen. You might do a lot worse than staying
right here in New York this fall and winter&mdash;you’d
be on the pay roll all right. We could make a
pretty good thing of it for you if you went in with us
and stood by us through thick or thin, right or wrong.
We might think of a lot of things we’d like to ask you.</p>

<p>“You’ve been talking a lot of bally rot about your
duty to these people&mdash;seeing that we wouldn’t rob
them in the price we paid for the land or the oil leases.
You know mighty well we can go down there and lease
a whole farm a hundred years for a dollar. Now, you
can crab our whole act&mdash;that’s easy to see&mdash;if you go
down there and tell those people they’re fools, and
that they ought to have two dollars an acre for their
oil rights&mdash;more’n we’ve paid them for <i>all</i> their coal
and their timber and their land any time these last
twenty years! You can see easily enough from the
class of men I’ve shown you here last night that we’ve
got all the money we need, all the money that anybody
needs to pay for what we want. But we want loyalty.
We want service. We want someone to stand with
us, thick or thin, right or <i>wrong</i>. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>Joslin looked at the puffy face of the man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
spoke, his heavy cheeks, his thickening neck, his watery
eyes, somewhat reddened about the rims. He replied
slowly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Haddon, I reckon I do understand,” said
he.</p>

<p>“Well, well, then, what about it? Do you find New
York such a poor place to live in? Isn’t there anything
here to light you up a little bit more than anything
you ever saw down in the Cumberlands?”</p>

<p>Joslin looked at him, his pale face going still paler.
“I’ve seen things here I didn’t know was in all the
world. But ye wasn’t asking me to sell out my own
people, was ye?”</p>

<p>“There you go again!” retorted the irritated man
across the table from him. “Rot! I’ve told you the
question of right or wrong don’t come into business at
all. Business is <i>business</i>. Highbrow things don’t
come into it at all. Don’t you want to know what
life is&mdash;don’t you want to branch out&mdash;don’t you want
to see what the world has&mdash;all the people in it, the
<i>life</i> of it? Why, man, at first you looked to me as
though you weren’t a sissy or a simp.”</p>

<p>The moisture on Joslin’s forehead meant nothing to
the man who faced him, who knew nothing of the
self-loathing, the self-reproach, that lay in Joslin’s
heart.</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, if you lived in this country for a
while you might change your point of view,” finished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Haddon, pushing back his chair. “What’s your hurry,
getting out of town? You haven’t got a cent to your
name, you don’t know where you’re going, you don’t
know what to do. I’m sorry for you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ye needn’t be,” said David Joslin. “Ye kain’t
pity a mounting man&mdash;he won’t have it!”</p>

<p>“Hell’s bells!” ejaculated the irate man whom he
addressed. “I’m not trying to change any of those
damned hill-billies down there. That’s not the question.
I put it up to you that you’re here in New York,
and you’ve got a chance to save up a little money to
<i>buy</i> your bally old education. You don’t have to lose
any of your principles. It’s just <i>making good</i>&mdash;that’s
all there is to it. If you want to make good you’re on.
If you don’t&mdash;good-by!”</p>

<p>He rose from the table, irritated, his nerves still
a-jangle; but a sort of compunction came to him, or
perhaps the feeling that he was making a business
mistake in crowding this man. A sudden half-smile
came to his face as he turned when the house man
brought his hat and stick for him.</p>

<p>“It’s a stiff gait we travel here,” said he. “Now
I’m going to my shop to see if I can earn a dollar or
two to pay the rent. I believe I’ll turn you over to
my chauffeur and let him drive you ‘bout town for
a day or so. You remember that kid that was there
last night&mdash;one that sang and played to us&mdash;Polly
Pendleton, her name was. I saw you having a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
look at that young dame. Some calico, what? Yeh,
some girl. Now, listen here&mdash;how’d you like to go
up and have a little visit with Polly around eleven-thirty
or so? I could fix it up. Touch of life, eh?
Gad, she seemed to be interested in you somehow&mdash;scared
or something. Now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>David Joslin went suddenly white. “Ye fergit, I
reckon&mdash;I told ye I was a married man. I’ve got a
wife&mdash;we had two children, down thar in Kentucky.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve got a wife too,” rejoined Haddon contemplatively.
“If I had any children I’d need that
much more of something to make me forget my condition
of servitude. I don’t know where the Missus
has gone to, but she’s shook us this morning, that’s
plain! You go up and talk religion to Polly, while I
go down to the office and try to make a dollar and a
quarter. Maybe you can save a human soul&mdash;eh?
That’s up to you.</p>

<p>“Life is so short,” he went on presently, finding a
cigarette in his pocket. “Why hang crêpe when life
is so darned short? I don’t blame you for wanting
to learn the alphabet and the multiplication table, but
if a man came to me and gave me a chance like this,
I’d postpone those things.”</p>

<p>Jimmy Haddon went grimly chuckling to his own
desk, and left the question of the gentleman from
Kentucky and the lady of Harlem strictly upon the
knees of the gods.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="pch">POLLY PENDLETON’S VISITOR</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE cynically smiling driver of Haddon’s car
at a late hour that morning deposited a solitary
passenger at the door of a certain apartment
building high up on Manhattan Island. Seeing
the bewilderment of his charge, the chauffeur himself
entered the elevator with him and touched as with no
unaccustomed hand a certain button near a door. He
then discreetly departed.</p>

<p>The door opened. There appeared almost in the
face of the waiting visitor the figure of a young
woman&mdash;exceedingly comely even at that hour of the
day&mdash;a young woman of oval face, of dark, long-lashed
eyes, of dark curling hair, of shapeliness of
figure scantly veiled by the pink kimono which she
wore in morning negligée.</p>

<p>It was Polly Pendleton. She was alone. Her
praiseworthy partner had before this arisen for her
morning cocktail, her morning coffee, her morning
cigarette, and her morning stroll downtown.</p>

<p>Joslin stood motionless, silent. In a flash she recognized
him. Then he stalked in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well!” said she. “I wasn’t expecting anyone this
morning.” She flushed, half angry. “I don’t allow
this.”</p>

<p>“My name is Joslin&mdash;David Joslin,” began her visitor.
“Ye don’t remember me&mdash;last night&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I do,” said Polly. “Of course I do. You
wore the same clothes then you’re wearing now.”</p>

<p>“They’re the only ones I have,” said the young man,
“an’ they’re not mine. I don’t reckon ye want me
to come in?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said she, for one half instant hesitant,
and closed the door. “Why not, after all?”</p>

<p>He looked about him curiously at the narrow quarters.
So, then, this was her home! These were her
belongings&mdash;the half-emptied glasses on the little
buffet, the ashes in a tray, the powder puff, pink-stained,
on the dresser-top, the manicure nail pad, the
little burnt cork on a hairpin’s end.</p>

<p>“Won’t you sit down?” began Polly Pendleton, more
flustered than she had ever been in all her life. “Will
you have a little drink?”</p>

<p>He looked at her in astonishment “Surely ye ain’t
meanin’ that ye’d take a drink of liquor, Ma’am?”
said he.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Polly Pendleton, with a <i>moue</i>, “once
in a long <i>while</i>&mdash;in case I’m not feeling well, you
know! How about yourself? You look rocky.”</p>

<p>He looked in grave contemplation at the half-filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
bottle upon the tiny buffet&mdash;the glasses which had seen
use.</p>

<p>“Ma’am,” said he, “sometimes in my country a man
takes a drink of liquor. Sometimes a woman smokes
a pipe. But I don’t think I’ll take no drink this
mornin’. It ain’t my usual custom.”</p>

<p>Polly seated herself in a deep-cushioned armchair
near the window, her half-consumed cigarette still between
her fingers. A pleasing enough picture she presented,
as, half leaning forward, she sat staring curiously
at this apparition of the morning.</p>

<p>“You’re an odd sort!” said she, at length, flinging
up a hand nervously. “Well, I’ve not got down to the
pipe yet.”</p>

<p>“Say, friend,” she went on suddenly, half apologetically,
“I was talking to my partner last night. She
said that she thought our act rather broke you up.
Of course you know it was all joshing&mdash;nothing more.
That’s the way we do at those dinner parties&mdash;they
sort of expect it of us girls, you know. There’s
nothing in it, of course. I hope you didn’t mind it?”</p>

<p>“No,” he said quietly, “I didn’t mind. The ways of
sin are allurin’, Ma’am.”</p>

<p>“What’s that!” But then she spread out her hands.
An awkward silence fell.</p>

<p>The eyes of David Joslin, roaming around the little
apartment, spied Polly’s violin resting upon the
dresser-top.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ye play the violin, Ma’am,” said he. “Ye’re
the first womern I ever knew in all my life who could.
I reckon ye studied?”</p>

<p>“Years,” said she simply. “It cost me a lot of
money&mdash;and at that they don’t like the best things I
do. You can play?”&mdash;eagerly.</p>

<p>“Only a few of the mounting tunes&mdash;ballets such
as our folks teached us years ago.”</p>

<p>“Ballads? You mean the folk songs?”</p>

<p>“Maybe. I could play ‘Barbara Allen.’ They tolt
me it was Scotch.”</p>

<p>“The Scotch have pretty melodies sometimes,” said
Polly Pendleton judicially. Then she smiled frankly.
“You see, I’m half Irish myself&mdash;and half French.”</p>

<p>“What?” David Joslin sat up suddenly and looked
at her straight. “Ma’am, my own granny was half
Irish and half French. There wasn’t nuvver a womern
in all the mountings like her. That maybe accounts
fer a heap of things. My granny loves to sing and
dance. She’s over ninety year old.”</p>

<p>The unweighed flattery of his tone was a thing to
be valued. She extended to him the instrument and
bow.</p>

<p>“Play for me,” said she. “Play ‘Barbara Allen.’
Do something for <i>me</i> this morning!”</p>

<p>So David Joslin, student of Calvin, Cumberland
mountaineer, self-elected minister&mdash;and as he now
fully felt, lost soul&mdash;thus cast away in a buffet flat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
of upper Manhattan, played the old ballad of “Barbara
Allen” to one of the gayest young persons at that
time in the great city. He played it in minors, bowing
very badly, missing the key sometimes a half-note
or so, slurring here, over-accentuating there,
phrasing after his own quaint mountain fashion, but
none the less producing something which might have
been called a melody. Polly’s foot began to beat
upon the floor, her fingers upon the arm of the chair.</p>

<p>“Man!” said she, after he had finished, “if I could
take you into vaudeville, we’d break this country!
That’s <i>class</i>!”</p>

<p>“It’s not much,” said he, misunderstanding. “I
nuvver had no lessons. I’ve nuvver been to school in
all my life, an’ I nuvver seen a music book in all my
life&mdash;I reckon that’s music ye got over thar?” He
nodded towards the sheets which he saw standing in
their rack.</p>

<p>“You’re an odd chap,” said she, with a strange softness
in her tone. “I’ve never seen a man like you&mdash;never
in all my life. You’re a strange chap. What
brought you here?”</p>

<p>“I come out, Ma’am, to build a college fer my people.
I come out to git my education. I come up here
with Mr. Haddon, jest to talk to a few friends of
his’n about timber an’ oil, ye know.”</p>

<p>“Jimmy Haddon, eh?” Polly’s lips set rather tight
together. “Well, he’s a good business man. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
have to hand him that. But say&mdash;keep an eye on
him, that’s all. Listen here, son&mdash;you’re what we
call ‘easy’ in the city. You don’t belong here&mdash;you’re
too straight&mdash;you’re too good for it.”</p>

<p>“What do ye mean?” said he. “Too good! I’m
the wustest of sinners. But if I accepted sin&mdash;say,
if I made a lot of money&mdash;several hundred dollars a
month&mdash;an’ had it clear&mdash;would ye tell me to throw
that over an’ go back home?”</p>

<p>The dark eyes of Polly Pendleton looked straight
into his face now.</p>

<p>“There’s a lot of things a girl can understand without
explaining very much,” said she, simply. She saw
the rising somber flame in this man’s eyes that met
her own so straight. And then, suddenly, he broke
out, all restraints gone.</p>

<p>“Last night ye <i>touched</i> me&mdash;it was in a joke&mdash;ye
was makin’ me foolish. Ye don’t know how foolish
ye made me then. Ye took away my brains. Ye got
my soul. God!”</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to talk that way to me!” flashed
Polly, swift tears in her eyes. “No, no&mdash;don’t&mdash;don’t!
It wasn’t right for me to make fun of you&mdash;I
ought to have known you were different. I came home
last night, and I talked about you to my partner.
Somehow, I don’t know why, you seem like a preacher
to me. Besides, once in a while a woman sees something
in a real man that gets close to her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>She rose now and spread out her arms, a very beautiful
vision of young womanhood, a sort of fair frailness
about her after all, in spite of her eager vitality
and her overflowing joy in life.</p>

<p>“Why, listen,” said she. “I know about men. You
needn’t make any map to explain anything more to
me. You’d be foolish, you’d be crazy; and I’ll not
have it. I’m not good enough for you. You mustn’t
stay here. You mustn’t be foolish over a girl like
me&mdash;I’m not worth it. I’m&mdash;I’m notgood!” She
slurred the last two words hurriedly together. “Get
on out of here before you’re spoiled.”</p>

<p>Her voice trembled. “The city will get you, some
time. It’s got me. It’s got my partner. We’re gone.
Lost souls! You? Oh, don’t, <i>don’t</i>! You haven’t
gone the gait that we have. Listen to me now&mdash;I
think enough of a good square chap not to want to
see him go the wrong way. Can’t you see that a
dancing girl can be a good pal after all? I’m trying
to <i>help</i> you.”</p>

<p>“Easy!” said he, his voice trembling in his own
self-scorn. “I had nothin’, only what ye taken away
from me.”</p>

<p>“Take some of this, won’t you?” said Polly Pendleton,
her doubled hands full of bills which she held
out to him, her dark eyes shining. “Here, take it.
Do something with it. You wouldn’t call that tainted
money, would you?... It isn’t tainted yet. Look!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>But he put back her hands. “No,” said he. “My
God! No! From ye?”</p>

<p>He hurt her, because she wholly mistook his real
meaning. Her face fell, but she shook her head
bravely, like a fighter taking a blow in the ring.</p>

<p>“Ye never cared,” he added; “ye don’t feel&mdash;ye
don’t care.” The low notes of his voice rumbled
through the little room.</p>

<p>An odd feeling of helplessness seized her all at once.
“It’s a good thing for you, I don’t,” said she at length.
“Don’t I know men are fools enough without making
another fool to add to the list? If I cared&mdash;good God,
if I <i>cared</i>! Why, I don’t <i>dare</i> care for anybody.
Now, don’t you think you’d better be going?”</p>

<p>She had his hat in her hand, and was replacing the
violin and bow.</p>

<p>He rose and stood before her, his hands clenched
tight, his eyes still burning, his voice vibrant.</p>

<p>“Ma’am,” said he, “I nuvver seen ye but once.
Maybe I nuvver will agin. But I’ll al-<i>ways</i>remember
what ye said to me.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I was hopin’ ye’d say it would be a good piece
of business fer me to stay here this winter fer a while.
I was hopin’ I could see ye an’ hear ye play some
time, now an’ then. I was hopin’&mdash;I was hopin’ what
I ortern’t to hope. Ma’am, I nuvver seen no womern
like ye in all my life. I reckon I nuvver will agin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” said Polly Pendleton, at length having herself
in hand, “you’ve got none the best of me at that&mdash;I’ve
seen a considerable many fools in my time, but
you’re the human limit, son! The best thing I can do
is to tie a can to you and get you started West as soon
as possible. You’ll spoil over <i>night</i>. You ain’t
strictly human. You’re the worst Rube that ever hit
this island from any place on earth. Get out now&mdash;you’re
liable to be arrested any minute!</p>

<p>“And yet,” she added&mdash;still laughing kindly, and
all the half-virginal softness of her original nature
coming into the wistfulness of her tone&mdash;“I’m so glad
you came! You’re a good sort.” She held out her
hand. “Listen, friend&mdash;when you think of me I hope
you’ll say I was a good sort too.”</p>

<p>He reached out his arms, his hands trembling.
“Ma’am,” said he, “I’m a married man. I had two
children, onct. My father was a preacher. Ye was
right, I’m startin’ out to be a preacher myself. I
was startin’ out to do something in the world to hep
the rest of them. But if ye hadn’t said what ye said
jest now to me, I’d be willin’ to throw it all away for
jest&mdash;for jest&mdash;for jest&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>How, he knew not, nor she, he caught her arms,
soft and white, in the grip of his great hands, and
stood looking down at her fiercely, she as helpless as a
child in his grasp.</p>

<p>She was struggling to escape him now. “It’s not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
right!” said she. “I’m alone here&mdash;Oh, are you any
kind of a man after all?”</p>

<p>At this he dropped her arms, his own falling lax.</p>

<p>“Why, of course I’m a man,” said he quietly. “Of
course I am. That’s all I am. I’m a lost man, a
damned one.”</p>

<p>“Go!” she whispered to him hoarsely. “I’m not
worth that. Go on away, and leave me something
decent to remember.” She heard the door close softly.</p>

<p>Within half an hour after Joslin had left, Polly
Pendleton, unfinished cigarette in hand, turned in her
cushioned armchair as she heard the strident call of
the telephone.</p>

<p>“Yes?” she replied. “Who is it, please?... You,
Jimmy?... No, don’t come up. I’m awfully busy
to-day.... I’ve got to work.</p>

<p>“Who?&mdash;the wild man?... Keep him?... Ask
him to stay here this winter? I should say <i>not</i>! I
told him to get out of town!</p>

<p>“Oh, come now, Jimmy,” she went on in rejoinder
to what she evidently heard. “There’s no use talking
that way.... Oh, you’re sore? Well, I can’t help
it. I wouldn’t have done any different even if you had
told me what you wanted.... You don’t care if I
never come back? Oh, very well&mdash;same to you, and
many of ‘em!... So long, Jimmy, and when you
get decent come up. I may let you in, and then again
maybe not.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW WAY</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">WHEN next Haddon and his wife met at the
breakfast table Haddon was more than ordinarily
out of sorts, his wife rather more
than ordinarily grave and silent. At length he flung
back from the table.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t it beat the devil,” said he, “how ungrateful
some people are! Here our hill-billy turns
up missing this morning. Where do you suppose he
is?”</p>

<p>“I fancy he’ll find his way back. Perhaps we’ll
hear from him soon.” She spoke quietly, not evincing
any of her own uneasiness over Joslin’s disappearance.</p>

<p>“You seem to have a very good notion of him and
his ways! I’ll say he didn’t have much politeness
about him&mdash;just to pull his freight without a word of
thanks. He may have left town for all I know.”</p>

<p>“He’s a strange man in some ways!”</p>

<p>“Well, if he’s gone, he’s thrown over the best chance
he ever had in his life. He didn’t have a cent when
we picked him up. I think he was a nut, that’s what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
I think he was, talking about starting a college when
he didn’t have the price of a pair of shoes to his
name. Why, our Company’d build him a half-dozen
colleges if he’d come along with us. I just wanted a
little more talk with him, and here he’s gone, no one
knows where.”</p>

<p>“I gave him the name of a little school out in the
town where I was born&mdash;don’t you know&mdash;Brandon
College?”</p>

<p>“Well, Brandon, Ohio, don’t happen to be on the
map of New York or the Cumberland Land and Mineral
Company.” He was scowling, his red face puffy,
unlovable.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” he concluded abruptly. “I’ve got to get
downtown to a meeting&mdash;and I’ve got a hell of a lot of
explaining to do. This Kentucky friend of yours has
put me in strictly Dutch.”</p>

<p>Without further salutation he turned to the hall
door. She rose, sighing, and passed out of the
room.</p>

<p>At just about the moment that the foregoing conversation
was taking place in Haddon’s home, another
interview was advancing, in the smoking room of a
west-bound passenger train heading from the city.
Of the speakers one was a grizzled old passenger
conductor who had spent his life on the line, who
stood now regarding a tall raw-boned young man,
whom he had been obliged to accost for a second time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
so much absorbed did he seem in a certain book over
which he was poring.</p>

<p>“<i>Tick</i>-ets, please!”</p>

<p>“Good mornin’,” said the young man, looking up.
“I didn’t buy any ticket, sir, because I didn’t have no
money. They let me through the gate in the crowd.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the conductor, “you’ve no business
here without one. Where do you want to go?”</p>

<p>“I’m a-goin’ to Brandon, Ohio,” replied the young
man, his fingers now between the pages of his closed
book. “I’ve got thirty-five cents to my name.”</p>

<p>“Brandon, Ohio&mdash;on thirty-five cents! What do
you think we are?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t expect ye to carry me all the way to
Brandon fer that much,” replied David Joslin. “I
only wanted to git out into the aidge of town if I
could, so I could find work. Please put me down
whar thar’s a brickyard, an’ I kin work my way. I’m
a-goin’ out thar to study to be a preacher, ye see.”</p>

<p>The gray old railway conductor looked at him steadily
for a time. There was something so frank in the
gray eyes that all he could do was to shake his head.
“I’ll see you when I’ve finished making my train,”
he growled, frowning; but he purposely delayed until
after the train was more than two hundred miles west
of the city!</p>

<p>“Well, young man,” said he then, “I guess you’d
better get off about here. My run ends here. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
quite a manufacturing town, and you can get work
in a brickyard, or most any place, I should think.
Lord knows, labor’s scarce enough so that anyone can
find work who really wants to work.”</p>

<p>“I thank ye very much, sir,” said David Joslin,
simply. “Ye’ve been right kind to me. I believe the
Lord will bless ye.”</p>

<p>The conductor, abashed, made no reply whatever,
but stood looking after him as he slowly strode up the
station platform, his gaze this way and that.</p>

<p>The kindly advice of the railroad man proved useful
Before mid-afternoon Joslin had once more engaged
in day labor in one of the brickyards of this
place, a city devoted to manufacturing interests. He
was delighted to find that here his wages would be
as much as a dollar and a half a day. The foreman
showed him a row of little buildings where, among
foreigners of all sorts, it might be possible to get quarters
and food sufficient to keep soul and body together.
Here, then, in a little room half lighted by flaring
gas light, within the sound of profanity and continuous
card-playing, David Joslin sat down for his first
evening alone in the great world of the Outside.</p>

<p>He began his daily practice of copying the letters
of the alphabet, using a piece of brown paper which
he had found, and the stub of a broken pencil. Having
completed a certain amount of this exercise, he
turned to the pages of his book, laboriously to read,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
as best he could, the words of old John Calvin, written
long ago, about Eve, and the Garden, and the Serpent
and the first great Sin.</p>

<p>He read until he slept even as he sat. But as he
slept he dreamed and started moaning. He felt on
him all the weight of the original Sin.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE CLANS</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IN THE two years that passed after David Joslin
left his home, no word was received from him by
any of his friends or his kin, even by his old
grandma left alone in the hill cabin. Even had he
written, few could have read. But no letter came to
the little post-office. David Joslin had vanished as
though swallowed up by the great Outside. His enemies
sneeringly declared him dead or else “run out.”
His friends had much to do to keep their faith in him,
Afterward a report came up from Windsor that he
had been seen there. None might know that David
Joslin was biding his time.</p>

<p>It was two years before a vague stirring came into
the life of the little settlement near which he had lived.
Then, upon a certain day of the late summer time,
there came winding down the rugged pathways of the
Cumberland coves, along the rocky creek bottoms, and
at length along the well-beaten trails of the larger
streams, little groups of riders. For the most part
they were tall and silent men, their eyes watchful as
they rode. All of them were armed. In many cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
a woman sat back of her husband on the family mule.
It was a gathering of the clans, and it was well known
that in case a man were hurt, his own women folks
could nurse him better than anyone else. As for that,
the women of the mountains were as grim and savage
as their lords and masters.</p>

<p>Slowly, steadily, watchful, alert, these strange people
of the hills came riding down, the little threads of
the broken procession converging toward the Forks
where, so went the vague word, there was going to
be a sort of meeting for a day or two&mdash;for what purpose,
few seemed to know. The general understanding
was that this meeting was to be held at the old mill
building across the river. The village postmaster and
the village blacksmith had passed the assembly call
impartially.</p>

<p>There was other advice of import tacitly accepted,
but, while it was generally understood that there might
be, and probably would be, a reckoning between the
tribes of the Gannts and the Joslins, those not immediately
concerned in the family quarrel treated both
parties with politeness. To carry word from one to
the other would have been an act of treason, and
punishable by the unwritten law of that country. Men
went about their daily duties and talked little even to
their own families.</p>

<p>The single street of the little village&mdash;scarce half a
hundred houses and shops in all&mdash;was filled now with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
groups of men idly strolling, every one of than armed,
old and young. Among these were boys, some not
older than fifteen years, yet each confident in his own
ability to draw quick and hold straight, and longing
for the chance. The fingers of many a youth itched
to get at the handle of the brand-new gun with which
before now he had practiced so faithfully, saving his
coppers for “hulls” to feed it. The older men strolled
about unagitated. Group passed group upon the
street, each man staring into the eyes of his enemy,
his own face immobile, over his eye an impenetrable
film&mdash;the eye of the dangerous man.</p>

<p>Men who casually estimated the respective representation
of the Joslins and the Gannts thought there
were forty or fifty men on each side. It was doubted
if half of these would ever get out of town unhurt.
The sheriff was somewhere far to the west, at the
county seat. There was no peace officer, nor would
it have been a good place for one. It was a meeting
of the clans. The Cumberlands were going about
their ancient business in their own ancient way.</p>

<p>Some, fitfully interested, spoke of the new railway
now advancing from the Middle Fork up Hell-fer-Sartin.
There was talk that a pike road had been
built in as far as the county seat from somewhere
very far in the west, as much as twenty miles. In a
general way there seemed to hang in the air an unsettled
feeling, as though all knew great events yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
might happen. The war Outside&mdash;the railroad now
impending&mdash;the old feud now about to break aflame
again&mdash;it was a grave time for these strange, somber
folk.</p>

<p>But a day passed, two days, and nothing broke.
The leaders studiously kept away from the young men
all that fiery liquor which, would be certain to set them
beyond control. The tenseness of the long hours began
to tell on all. Men became restless&mdash;boys stood
here and there in groups, talking sullenly, looking this
way and that, nodding a head hither or yon. But
after their old and usual fashion, the leaders of both
factions held them together&mdash;old Absalom Gannt and
Chan Bullock and their respective attendants. “Wait,
fellers,” was the arresting word that went around.
“Come to the meetin’ at the mill.”</p>

<p>The main floor of the mill building at the Forks
afforded a room perhaps fifty feet in one dimension,
low-ceiled and dark. The reticent postmaster and the
blacksmith had provided a few flickering lamps. And
finally thither, soon after twilight of the appointed
day, the mountaineers turned, group by group, man
after man, silently, two score Joslins and as many or
more of the Gannts, all of them too proud to stay
away even though a stern mystery lay ahead. Every
man of them was armed, every one of them ready for
what might come. The old mill building, the only
meeting place tacitly held neutral and the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
practical town hall available, bade fair to see red history
this night.</p>

<p>And there was history done that very night. They
had all gathered, the men of both clans, thronging the
dark interior. For half an hour they had sat, silent
and alert, squatting here or there on their heels, slouching
on sacks of grain or something of the sort. The
Gannts were on the left-hand side, the Joslins on the
right, as one entered the door. No one seemed to
know what was expected. There still was mystery as
to what had brought them here. Perhaps the postmaster
and the blacksmith knew. If so, they would
tell in time. That word had been passed to the Gannts
that the Joslins would be here, and to the Joslins that
the Gannts would come, was the only sure thing; and
it was quite enough.</p>

<p>The blacksmith and the postmaster passed here and
there, setting alight their lamps. No man spoke on
either side. Both factions sat looking across the little
white-floored lane of No Man’s Land which lay between
them. A quick motion, a shout, the sound of a
shot, would have been fatal to half the men present
here; but if any one of them felt agitation, it was not
manifest by any word or sign, by any paling of the
face or trembling of the hand. Unagitated, calm, they
sat, each with his eye on his own selected man, ready
for what might happen.</p>

<p>What did happen was this: The door darkened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
against the pale starlight. There stepped slowly into
the interior, where the shadows lay heavy upon the
floor, the figure of a tall man.</p>

<p>It was a man whom they all knew. As he came
into the circle lighted by the lamps, a sort of sigh
went up, audible in its united volume.</p>

<p>It was David Joslin!</p>

<p>Now they knew why they were to come here. The
leader of the Joslins had come back! That meant
trouble. He had not died&mdash;everybody knew that&mdash;everybody
had heard from down the river that he had
run out and left the country. But now he had got
courage to come back!</p>

<p>Yes, it meant trouble. The men on both sides eased
off their pistol belts, loosened their holsters, under
pretense of settling their coat tails or fumbling for
tobacco.</p>

<p>But David Joslin raised his hand at once. “Wait!”
said he. So, still silent, still motionless, they sat and
looked at him, many in contempt, as many in judgment
suspended.</p>

<p>He seemed thinner even than when he had left.
His face bore a certain scholarly whiteness visible
even under the burning of the sun&mdash;Joslin did not tell
them so, but the truth was he had walked more than
half the way from Brandon College&mdash;where for two
years he had slaved at learning as no man in all the
history of that school had been thought able to slave.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Penniless at his hopeless start, he still was penniless
after his overleaping of all rules and schedules and
curricula. He had walked to this, his great trial. In
some way he had been fed. In his own conviction
that had been by direct act of God.</p>

<p>Better clad than when he had left, in a dark suit
of clothing which did not fit him ill, with shoes at
least not badly broken, and with certain touches of
refinements of the civilization outside, none the less
he remained the mountain man they had known so
well. But something in his voice seemed different
His diction had altered perceptibly, if not consistently.
He stood before them now at ease, a leader,
a speaker, even an orator of some sort, at least in the
possession of that gift of oratory which in simple
terms commands the attention of an audience.</p>

<p>“Wait!” said David Joslin. “Don’t make any move.
I know why you’re here as well as you do, maybe a
good deal better. I sent word in for you all to come.
I’ve asked you to come here myself&mdash;I arranged this
meeting with some of my friends here at the Forks.
I wanted every moonshiner and feudist in the mountains
to be right here to-night, where I could look him
in the eye, and he could look me in the eye, and we
could have it out together.</p>

<p>“No! I don’t mean to have it out in the old way.
I want to tell you those times are past I see you
sitting there, Absalom Gannt&mdash;I know you’re not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
a-scared of me, and I’m not a-scared of you. You’re
fighting men, every one of you. And you’ve come
here to fight each other once more&mdash;to kill each other,
just like you and I and our fathers have been doing
here in these mountains farther back than any of us
can remember. You don’t know why you do that, but
you think you ought to do it. It’s a sort of religion
with us, just to kill each other. We don’t know no
better&mdash;we never have.</p>

<p>“You thought I was a coward because I didn’t tell
anyone where I was going. I didn’t tell any of my
own people. In a way, I just sneaked out of this
country, that’s true, because I wasn’t yet sure about
it all. I went down the river. I got to the railroad.
I went up North. After a while I got so that I could
go to school. That’s what taken me out of the
mountains.</p>

<p>“Before I left these hills I had resolved to learn
how to read and write and to cipher a little bit. I
didn’t know then how much there was to be learned in
the world. I didn’t know how hard it was to start&mdash;nor
how easy once you get started.</p>

<p>“I’ve been at school less than a quarter of the time
any boy of these hills ought to have been there. I’ve
learned more than I thought there was to be learned
anywhere. And this is the first thing I’ve learned&mdash;that
it’s time we mountaineers stopped raising our
children for the slaughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve learned that the only way to stop that sort of
thing is by way of schools. You know how my own
father died, and he was a preacher. I’m a-going to
be a preacher myself some time&mdash;I’ve preached once
or twice&mdash;they made me, up North there. But I don’t
want to preach now. I just want to talk to my
neighbors.</p>

<p>“Now, I didn’t run away. You know I won’t
flicker. If it’s war, I’m here for war&mdash;but I don’t
want it to be war.</p>

<p>“Outside, in the Old World, where our great-grandpaps
came from once, maybe, they’re having war.
It’s worse than any of you dream. But they’re all
fighting for a principle, as they think. We’re fighting
for nothing down here.</p>

<p>“Now, I want to see peace in the Cumberlands. I’m
telling you, I want to start a college right here, on the
hill yonder. I’m going to do that some time. Don’t
you believe me?”</p>

<p>He was looking straight at old Absalom Gannt,
and the old man, his eyes fixed steadily upon the
speaker, answered him now.</p>

<p>“What law have we got to believe ye? Ye’ve got
no money to start a school. Ye couldn’t keep a
teacher thar if ye did.” Thus old Absalom.</p>

<p>“That’s true,” replied David Joslin quietly. “That’s
the Gospel truth! As I stand here now I haven’t got
two dollars in my pockets. It’s plumb taken all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
money I’ve got to keep the soul alive in my body so I
could study hard as I had to. But when I do get
through up there, I promise you I’ll come here and
start a college. Money or no money&mdash;help or no help&mdash;I’ll
come and start that college! If I do, will you
promise me that between now and that time you’ll
not start any trouble here?”</p>

<p>The grizzled old man&mdash;leader of his people, therefore
leader by strength of mind as well as body&mdash;sat
silent now, looking him straight in the face, and Joslin
returned his gaze with equal fearlessness.</p>

<p>“You know I never flickered, Absalom Gannt!
You know my people won’t run away, not one of
them. You know I won’t run away. You all know
why I left; and now you know why I’ve come back.</p>

<p>“I’ve come here to do a mighty work, you’ll have
to admit that fair. It’s a terrible task for all of us.
We’ve got to change the ways we’ve been living here
for more than a hundred years. We’ve got to break
a hole in this wall that shuts us out of the world where
we belong, that makes us children and paupers where
we ought to be men and citizens. We’ve got to make
our own way out.</p>

<p>“Now, if I agree with you to make you a college,
and keep it open&mdash;a place where the children of these
mountains can come to learn to read and write and
cipher, and maybe go higher than that&mdash;if I can bring
people here from the outside to show you what a big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
world it is that you don’t know about&mdash;tell me, will
you promise me to keep the peace ontel I’ve succeeded
or failed&mdash;ontel I’ve made good or ontel I’ve told you
I’m a failure?</p>

<p>“Oh, I haven’t got much,” he went on hurriedly.
“I’ve had a hard enough time up there&mdash;they laughed
at me at first&mdash;I was ignorant as a child&mdash;I was only
a savage, a wild man, ignorant as any nigger in the
world&mdash;and wild&mdash;wild. And I was as big a sinner
as any in the world&mdash;I had a lot of things to forget&mdash;me
trying to be a preacher. Oh! haven’t I sinned!
But I thought if I would come down here and get
you all together and promise you that if you didn’t
like what I told you, you could kill me here&mdash;it seemed
to me it would part way make up for the heap of
sinning I’ve done in my life, young as I am.</p>

<p>“I’m a Joslin. You’re Gannts over there&mdash;you and
your kinpeople. We’re fine men, both families of us
here. We can kill fifty fine men here in three minutes.
Or we can build a school up yonder on the
hill, across the river, inside of a couple of years.
Which do you want to do?”</p>

<p>He stood silent for a long time, and all he heard
was the heavy, half-panting breathing of the men at
his right, at his left. There was not the shuffling of
a foot, not the movement of a hand on either side.
The eyes of each faction were glued upon the faces of
the other. A tenser scene could not have been; nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
could aught but starkest courage have evoked and
dared it.</p>

<p>There came a movement upon one side of the dimly
lighted room. A hundred hands went backward, a
hundred pairs of eyes gleamed.</p>

<p>It was old Absalom Gannt who had moved. But
his right hand went up above his shoulder, above his
head. And it was empty!</p>

<p>He rose slowly now to his full, gnarled height, and
stood, his right hand, empty, still above his head.</p>

<p>“Wait, boys!” he said. He turned and looked
toward his right. Silently as a cat in his motion, Chan
Bullock had also risen. But as he saw Absalom’s hand
thrown up thus, he himself paused. The two faced
one another, each sternly gazing into the face of his
foe.</p>

<p>Joslin himself stood motionless, looking from the
one to the other, his own hands dropped empty at his
sides. He had spoken. But he knew that the fate of
the Cumberlands rested here on the decision of these
two men.</p>

<p>One false movement on the part of anyone, and
the closed space had been a shambles. But Bullock
with a quick gesture threw his own right hand above
his head. He advanced toward old Absalom, the latter
toward him, steadily, grimly, each with boring
eyes that never yet had “flickered.” Then there was
heard a strong and calm voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fer’s I’m concerned,” said old Absalom Gammt,
“I’m through if ye fellers air.”</p>

<p>“Suits me,” rejoined Bullock.</p>

<p>And so closed the meeting at the Forks of the
Kentucky.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE CROSSROADS</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IF EVER was happy wayfarer, that was David Joslin,
as now he held his course back to the little
Ohio village which had been his home these past
two years. He walked eagerly, hurrying as does a
man who realizes that there is much to be done with
little time for the doing.</p>

<p>He had no staff nor scrip, nor needed any in the
course of his journey out from the Cumberlands to
the edge of the great plateau. Here he found the
railway leading to the north, and followed its line as
any common tramp, for the good reason that he had
not money for railway fare. Certain gentry of the
road he met, but they neither accepted him as one
of the guild, nor hindered him in his going, for they
could not classify this man who walked slightly
stooped, with pale face, but with long and steady
stride, a man whose clothing betokened no luxury,
but who still had something about him which did not
grade him as one of the hopeless drifters of the
world.</p>

<p>At a little town along the road another kindly railway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
conductor lifted him far along his northern journey,
so that presently he was coming to the lower edge
of what might have been called the North; for now
he approached the great Ohio River and its scattered
string of thriving communities. He had eaten only
when he found the means to pay for what he ate.
Twice he found it necessary to stop in a little town
and work for a period of a day or so. Rarely did
he sleep in a room. He was still a man of the wilderness.</p>

<p>And he was happy, was David Joslin. For the
first time, it seemed to him, the clouds were lifting
from his soul. Now, it seemed to him, he had done
something to offset his own sin.</p>

<p>Driving his worn body mercilessly, he was footsore
and weary when at length he arrived in one of the
little towns on the banks of the Ohio River, a junction
point where all the north and south railway was
crossed by one of the greater systems running east
and west, a place of some five or six thousand inhabitants&mdash;one
of those many communities which have
their own pretensions at metropolitanism, each like
to a thousand others.</p>

<p>Certain features of these centers of civilization still
continued to interest Joslin, a man of such extraordinary
lack of opportunity. He stood to-day, therefore,
boylike, reading the lettering on the Strattonville
billboards which announced certain attractions in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
theaters and cinema houses for that evening. And he
saw something which caused him to flinch as though
smitten.</p>

<p>He could not turn away from the great letters which
he saw, two feet or more, widely displayed.</p>

<p class="pc1 mid">POLLY PENDLETON! POLLY PENDLETON!<br />
<span class="small">HER OWN COMPANY<br />
DIRECT FROM HER GREAT BROADWAY SUCCESS</span></p>

<p class="p1">Polly Pendleton! Polly Pendleton! David Joslin
knew not how many times the name stood there in
print. That a team of vaudeville artists had grown
into a certain vogue in the city; that this vogue had
become, for one of the performers, a sort of reputation;
that a concert singer had grown into being something
of an actress, and the actress into some sort of
a star heading a company of her own; that this star
and her company&mdash;whether for reasons of success or
lack of success&mdash;had left the city to tour “the provinces”&mdash;David
Joslin knew none of these things. All
he knew, or cared to know, or could understand, was
that without doubt she was here! She, the <i>corpus
delicti</i> of his sin!</p>

<p>As the criminal will return to the very place of his
crime, so now David Joslin found his feet going where
he did not list. There came into his soul a great recklessness.
He forgot the occupation of his last two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
years, forgot the long road before him. Independence,
prodigality, seized him as fully as it might any gilded
youth. So, since prodigality also is a wholly relative
thing, David Joslin bought him a ticket to the theater
that night, repaired to a nearby restaurant, and ate
what was to him the most expensive meal of all his
life.</p>

<p>No longer the happy wayfarer, but an anxious,
downcast and distraught man, on his soul a shadow,
he found his way to his seat&mdash;his first time in any actual
theater. The whirl of it all, the light, the warmth,
the color, the music, at first were things rather of torture
to him. Where was she?</p>

<p>But presently she came, bowing, smiling, light-footed&mdash;it
was she, her very self! Yes, these were
her eyes, dark and large as ever. Her little mouth,
turned up a-corner, was as sweet as ever. Her dark
hair curled as it did that other time. Her straight
young figure was the same, with all its tender curves.
Above all, her frank smile, her compelling air of comradery,
were just the same as then, that time, two
years ago.</p>

<p>She had the same little habit of balancing up and
down on her toes, impatient for the music to give her
her cue. Her little chuckling laugh of sheer enjoyment
in herself and in life was just the same. She was
still the very spirit of life and joy she had been yonder,
two years ago&mdash;two centuries ago it seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
David Joslin! Then he had been another man. And
now&mdash;he was again that other man!</p>

<p>As to the play, so-called, it was nothing to him, and
he knew not how long it endured. The concordance
of the strings and brasses meant naught to-night,
though otherwise they might have meant much indeed,
new as they were to his acquaintance. He sat mute,
his eyes fixed steadily upon one figure upon the stage,
the sum total of the sensuous appeal lost for him in
the charm of its central figure.</p>

<p>And then, electric, a clash in the music touched him
to the marrow. The orchestra leader waved his baton.
A few violins, a flute or two, struck into the opening
bars of an air that David Joslin knew!</p>

<p>Polly Pendleton was at that moment off-stage, but
now ran tripping from the wings, smiling, shrugging
up her scant shoulder strap as she came. Her violin
was under her arm. She waved a hand to quiet the
enthusiasm, and played with the orchestra a few staves
of the air.</p>

<p>“You’re the Only Man for Me”&mdash;that was what
Polly Pendleton would play, of course. Did not David
Joslin know?</p>

<p>When she came to the chorus, she stepped down to
the footlights and extended her two round, white arms,
bare to the shoulder&mdash;her slender, up-curved little fingers
reaching almost to the face of the bald-headed
leader of the orchestra, himself of a family of eight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
To him she sang, her eyes dark and pleading, her little
feet tiptoeing, her voice no less than blandishment itself&mdash;“For
you are my Baby&mdash;you are my Baby&mdash;you’re
the only, only, <i>only</i> man for me!” And then
Polly Pendleton laughed with her audience at the jest
of it.</p>

<p>She ran off-stage, but must come back again, to be
sure. This time she raised her hands and her eyes to
a solid-looking citizen, who sat in a proscenium box&mdash;a
banker and a leading figure of the town, it chanced,
well known to all in the audience. To him also, pleadingly,
bewitchingly, she asserted, “You’re the only,
only, <i>only</i> man for me!”</p>

<p>And so in time Polly Pendleton hitched up her
shoulder-strap once more, and ran off in her final
exit.</p>

<p>David Joslin found himself, slightly reeling, passing
out to the open air with the others. Some men
whistled, others bore copies of a song, which they had
purchased from the ushers at the door. He never
could remember how or why he went to the principal
hotel. Certainly it was not to find quarters for himself.
Aimlessly he walked down the cross hall of the lobby
to another entrance; and so sheer accident favored him.</p>

<p>He knew that the rustle of skirts at the door of the
“ladies’ parlor” meant the presence of the woman he
sought&mdash;knew it by some strange super-sense that came
to him. A moment later Polly Pendleton herself appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
at the door, looking across the hall to the open
door of the café upon the other side.</p>

<p>“All right, Jimmy,” she called out to someone beyond,
invisible to Joslin. “I’ll be in right away.
Order me a milk-fed, won’t you, and a bottle of pale&mdash;with
you in just a minute.”</p>

<p>She stepped back into the parlor. Without announcement,
Joslin followed on in, and so once more
found himself face to face with her.</p>

<p>She stepped back, startled, surprised, frightened almost.
“Oh!” she exclaimed; and then frowned. “I
didn’t ask for anyone. Who are you?” she demanded.</p>

<p>Then with a sudden revelation she remembered.
Yes, pale and hot-eyed as when she had seen him last;
it was the same man, the wild man from the mountains!</p>

<p>She could not quite evade him. “What do you
want? How did you get in here?” she gasped.</p>

<p>He did not answer at first, and she herself, not
knowing what manner of scene might be expected,
resourcefully took him by the sleeve and led him far
over to the further corner, where a sofa afforded seats
for two. She pushed him down into one end of it, and
moved as far as possible into the other.</p>

<p>“You don’t remember me?” His voice was broken
and hoarse. She nodded.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk so loud. They’ll hear us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>He seemed unconscious of her warning.</p>

<p>“Why are you here?” he demanded, as though she
owed him an explanation.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you seen? We’re playing here to-night
This one-night business is getting my goat.”</p>

<p>David Joslin stared at her. “I know&mdash;I saw it all.
Sometimes a man’s hard to manage.” His voice was
savage.</p>

<p>“That’s the truth!” said Polly Pendleton. “I’m not
big enough to throw you out, and I don’t like to call
the porter, but I’ve got to have my supper before long.
Have you had yours?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It cost me six bits. That’s the mostest I ever
spent for one meal in all my life.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” said Polly wistfully. “I wish I could
get mine down to that scale! Sometimes it’s&mdash;well,
rather more.”</p>

<p>“It left me thirty-five cents,” said David Joslin, smiling
bitterly.</p>

<p>“Huh! That’s just about what you had the last
time you saw me. Is it the same thirty-five cents you
had then?”</p>

<p>Again she laughed, and then rippled out in her irrepressible
generosity, her sympathy. “Poor chap!”
said she. “Haven’t you got ahead any farther than
that in two years?” Polly Pendleton could not see
any suffering unmoved. She herself had lived.</p>

<p>“It’s odd,” she said, something of his old story coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
back to her. “You must be thirty-five or six,
aren’t you?&mdash;or maybe forty?”</p>

<p>“Not yet quite thirty,” said he.</p>

<p>“And you said you were married?”</p>

<p>“I was&mdash;once.”</p>

<p>“Then what are you doing here? What were you
doing there in my apartments in New York? Don’t
you ever stop to think?”</p>

<p>“I’ve stopped to think about everything in my life
except this. But now all that’s done. I’m not going
back to school any more.” He looked directly at her
now.</p>

<p>“Why? What do you mean? Why do you say
that? You talk foolish! Why, listen, where do you
get this sort of stuff, anyhow? What are you making
me out to be? Have I ever asked anything of
you, I’d like to know? What do I owe you, or you
owe me? I don’t get you, neighbor.”</p>

<p>“No, I reckon not,” said David Joslin, still staring
at her steadily from his end of the sofa in the dim
light. “I don’t reckon you do. I don’t reckon a woman
like you can understand a man like me.”</p>

<p>“Am I so bad, then? God! I wish there wasn’t a
man in all the world, that’s all&mdash;I’m sick of them! I’ve
got to make a living, haven’t I? Well, it’s jolly hard
business sometimes to do that. Why, listen&mdash;it’s only
an angel, and a good one, that’s kept us on our feet.
I’m wearing all my old clothes and hats and things.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
And I don’t know if I can go back to Broadway again.
You don’t have all the trouble in the world.”</p>

<p>“An angel?” said David Joslin, not in the least
understanding her, more than she had him in his last
remark, which she thought so slighting to herself.
“Yes, I reckon it was an angel brought you to me. I
was walking through here, going back to my school,
and here I find you! It was as though an angel of
heaven had brought us two together. What for?”</p>

<p>“You can search me!” said Polly Pendleton. “I
haven’t got the answer. All sorts of things happen in
this game, of course, but I’m free to say I wasn’t looking
for you to-night&mdash;and to tell the truth”&mdash;she rippled
out in laughter again&mdash;“I don’t know what to do
with you now I’ve got you. Won’t you please go
away? I’m getting pretty hungry, man!”</p>

<p>“Miss Pendleton,” said David Joslin, “that’s not
the way to treat me.”</p>

<p>Silence fell between them. Polly Pendleton, hurt
and grieved still over the sting of his earlier words&mdash;which
he had spoken only in condemnation of himself,
not her, began to tremble about her lips.</p>

<p>She heard his low, vibrant voice go on. “I couldn’t
bear to see you reach out your hands to those men there
to-night. You touched <i>me</i>, once! For sake of that,
I’m quitting my school.”</p>

<p>“It was only in a song!” she broke out “I’ve done
that to a thousand men, I expect, and I didn’t care a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
cent for any one of them. It’s in the game&mdash;it’s part
of my way of making a living. I’ve got to live.”</p>

<p>She laughed now with half a sob. “There can’t be
in all the world any one man for me, I suppose&mdash;that’s
the price we have to pay, who do this sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you at all.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t&mdash;I won’t&mdash;there isn’t&mdash;&mdash;” replied
Polly somewhat incoherently. “Listen, man! You’ve
got to stop this! I can’t stand it. This means too
much to you. You’ve taken it all in earnest when there
wasn’t anything to it but a joke&mdash;a game&mdash;a business.
And besides&mdash;I told you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What do you mean that you told me?”</p>

<p>“I told you&mdash;that&mdash;that I wasn’t good! Do you
think that’s easy for me to say?”</p>

<p>“A woman as beautiful as you could not be anything
but good.”</p>

<p>“Don’t! I can’t stand this&mdash;I told you once before
I couldn’t stand it.”</p>

<p>“How can I help it? I told you a man is hard to
manage.”</p>

<p>“You’re the hardest to manage I ever saw. What
can I do with you? I want to be as good a scout as
I can&mdash;I don’t really want to take money away from
blind babies, nor love’n affection from idiot Johnnies.
I don’t want you at all, and you mustn’t want anything
to do with me at all. Do you suppose it’s easy for
me to say that? Why don’t I let you make a fool of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
yourself the way they all do? Search me&mdash;I don’t
know! Listen&mdash;have you ever doped this thing out all
the way down the line? What’s in your mind&mdash;what
would you like to do?&mdash;what would you like to have
me do?”</p>

<p>“I never thought it out I&mdash;I don’t know. I don’t
understand this at all. I don’t know why I came here
to-night, to see you again.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s suppose now that I was a single woman,
and you were a single man. It isn’t true in your case,
and we won’t say anything about mine. Suppose we
were both free to do as we liked? How far do you
suppose, my friend, that thirty-five cents would go in
backing a theatrical company like this, that carries
thirty-eight performers, its own sets and its own
brass?”</p>

<p>Polly Pendleton, dependable always to do the unexpected,
was not laughing now, but half sobbing, and
wiping her eyes on the corner of her skirt.</p>

<p>“I wish’t you wouldn’t do that. Please don’t!” he
exclaimed. “I can’t tell you how it hurts me.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s you that’s done it,” she flared at him over
the corner of her ruffles, forgetting a half limb exposed.
“Did I ask you to come here? Is it the part
of a real man to make it harder for a fellow like me,
that’s trying to get on in the world?”</p>

<p>“I don’t reckon I’ve thought of that,” said David
Joslin with sudden contrition. “I reckon I was just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
thinking of my own self. I know the place in my book
that covers that. It’s about Adam&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never mind about Adam!” said Polly Pendleton.
“Don’t I know! If you were just a case of an average
Johnnie that had money and no brains, I’d maybe take
you on and jolly well separate you. Such things have
happened. But here you are with no money and a lot
of brains. Excuse me, my friend, but you don’t seem
to just qualify for running a theatrical company. Besides&mdash;I
like you a lot. I told you that before. But
when I sing, ‘You’re the only man for me,’ that’s what
I <i>don’t</i> mean&mdash;what I <i>never</i> mean. Can’t you understand
that? I wish you’d never seen me.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know there could be a woman like you in
all the world&mdash;I didn’t know what a woman really
meant.”</p>

<p>“It’d be fine to have a man really believe in you;”
half sobbing now. “It’d be mighty fine to listen to
that line of talk, even if you couldn’t believe in it.”</p>

<p>Polly Pendleton shrank back into her corner of the
sofa, and wrung her little white hands together; but
finally she suddenly turned to him once more, one knee
bent, her foot under her, as she faced him on the sofa
at last.</p>

<p>“There may be women who could break a man and
throw away the pieces for the fun of it. Nix on the
vamp for little Polly. Oh, dear! I don’t want to talk.
I’m tired. What made you come here at all? The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
trouble with you is, you don’t know what an angel
face is. You think I’m the way I look. I’m not!”</p>

<p>Polly was sobbing freely now into the corner of her
skirt. “I’m not, I tell you! Don’t you know&mdash;and
I’d rather have told that to anybody in all the world
than you&mdash;you’re so damned honest!”</p>

<p>He made no answer at all, and she went on.</p>

<p>“You’ve been such a boob that you haven’t done
anything wrong. You’ve got your education ahead of
you. I’m twenty-six years old, and I know more than
you will when you’re a hundred and twenty-six. You
don’t need to have a house fall on you, do you? Come
now! I don’t”&mdash;and here, in spite of all, she laughed
through her unwilling tears&mdash;“I don’t want your little
old thirty-five cents at all! Take it and go on, and
save the country, friend.”</p>

<p>David Joslin sat for a long time. “Sometimes
things are hard to figure out,” said he at last.</p>

<p>“Yes!” said Polly Pendleton in a low voice. “Don’t
I know?”</p>

<p>There was no answer save his white-knuckled hands.</p>

<p>After a time she hitched up the other foot on the
sofa, and sat, her arms about her knees, staring at him
that way, her eyes gleaming in the dim light, impulsive
still as a child herself&mdash;as indeed she was always to
remain.</p>

<p>“Listen!” said she. “I’ve got an idea. Come now&mdash;you
seem rather like a priest to me&mdash;it didn’t seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
wrong for me to tell you things. Will you make a
trade, honor bright?”</p>

<p>“If I gave you my word,” said David Joslin
soberly, “I’d keep it.”</p>

<p>“If you’ll promise to go on and do what you said
you’d do&mdash;your education&mdash;your college&mdash;I’ll agree to
quit this business in about two months, and when I do
I’ll go into the Red Cross.”</p>

<p>He did not answer her at all. Unconsciously, after
how long a time neither of them could have told, they
both had arisen. He stood before her, motionless, she
herself slightly swaying. Impulsively, she extended
her hands towards him in the twilight of the room.</p>

<p>“I know you!” said she. “I know what you want
You want to kiss me, don’t you?” She looked at him
gravely.</p>

<p>He could not answer. He made no motion. But
Polly Pendleton knew now that if any salutation came
from this man it would be from a different man than
the one who had entered this room a half-hour previous.
In short, she knew, whether or not he knew it,
that David Joslin was saved.</p>

<p>“Among so many&mdash;&mdash;” began Polly Pendleton, trying
to laugh and half sobbing. “Oh, well&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He never knew how or when he found the street.</p>

<p>Across the hall appeared the red and irate face of
a gentleman who, apparently, had long been waiting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where on earth have you been, kid?” he demanded
querulously. “Everything’s getting cold.”</p>

<p>“Oh, have a heart, old dear,” said Polly Pendleton,
dabbing indefinitely at her countenance with a handkerchief.
“I had to powder my nose, didn’t I?”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE ORIGINAL SIN</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">AS JOSLIN wandered along a street unknown to
him, lighted by flickering arc lights, he was
not conscious of the exercise of any of his
faculties, but a faint, sweetish smell came to him, a
thing familiar in its way. It was the smell of distilled
liquors. He looked up, and saw by the sign above the
door that here one by the name of John Moran sold
aged whiskeys bonded in the wood.</p>

<p>Inside, the room was still light, though now the
proprietor was beginning to put away his bottles for
the night, it being past midnight. Joslin turned in at
the door without any definite purpose in his mind.
The proprietor looked at him inquiringly, standing at
attention behind the bar. Joslin swayed slightly as he
approached, and placed his last two coins upon the
counter. The bar man was of the very plausible belief
that his customer was already the worse for
liquor.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said he, “that’s all the money I have. I want
to rest here to-night if I may. I want to give you the
dime, and I want you to let me keep this quarter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m just closing up,” began the man, pushing back
his bottles upon the shelf.</p>

<p>Joslin looked at him straight as he replied:</p>

<p>“I know, but I’m alone in this town, and I’ve no
place to lay my head. I’m in trouble. Perhaps you
know what trouble means?”</p>

<p>The man looked at him curiously, accustomed as he
was to all the vagaries of alcohol.</p>

<p>“Have one on the house,” said he at length, and
pushed the bottle once more toward his customer.</p>

<p>Joslin picked up the flask with trembling hand, and
poured out a full drink into the glass. He raised it
to his lips, but did not drink.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said he, “I find I do not need to drink.”</p>

<p>The proprietor, was disposed to be irritable. “On
your way, neighbor,” said he, “This is a saloon, and
we sell liquor here.”</p>

<p>Joslin perhaps did not fully understand all that he
said. Once more he pushed both the coins back across
the bar top. “Please, my friend,” said he, “I’m very
tired. I come to you as to one who will aid the needy.
Let me sit to-night in that chair by the little table
yonder. Put the glass on the table by me. In the
morning I’ll be here if the liquor in the glass has not
been tasted&mdash;and then I can go on my way, as you say.
If the liquor is gone, you will have had pay for it&mdash;take
this larger coin&mdash;but I will not be here then.</p>

<p>“I’d like to sit here and read, that’s all,” he added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
after a while, since the other made no reply. “I have
no other place to go.”</p>

<p>“Who are you, bo?” asked the saloon-keeper curiously.
His education in human nature did not often
lead him astray. He knew now this was no ordinary
drunk, and no ordinary man. “What’s your line?”
he asked again.</p>

<p>“I’m a preacher, sir,” replied Joslin, “or I was to
have been&mdash;till to-night.”</p>

<p>The barkeeper laughed shortly. “Well, I believe
you’d fight fair,” said he. And then quickly, “Say, I’ll
take a chance with you! I’ll leave you here to-night.
I believe you’re up against it. You can drink yourself
crazy, or steal all the stock if you like. Or you can
do as you say&mdash;stay here until I come back in the
morning.”</p>

<p>Joslin looked at him, still swaying slightly, his hands
upon the polished wood, steadying himself.</p>

<p>“To some men I’d say, ‘Take a drink and pull together,’
but with you I won’t,” said the proprietor.
“Fight it out. It’s a man’s game, friend. By morning
you’ll know whether you’re going up or down.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll accept that risk with a stranger?” said
Joslin.</p>

<p>“You’ve got the risk&mdash;this night will have bigger
chances in it for you than for me! Two or three
drinks and I might find you on the floor in the morning.
None at all, and I may find you sitting there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Risk’s yours, not mine. If that’s the way you want
it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, fly to it, friend,” he concluded, chuckling
grimly. “Don’t ask it again&mdash;I don’t know what I
might do.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Joslin, “I shall never have another night
like this. Let me sit here and read to-night. I will
thank you al-<i>ways</i>.”</p>

<p>“You’re a mountain man,” said the saloon-keeper
suddenly, noticing the accent on the last syllable.</p>

<p>Joslin nodded.</p>

<p>“They’re hardy, and sometimes they can keep away
from liquor. Well, luck to you.”</p>

<p>He pulled down the apron screening the shelves of
bottles, and coming around the end of the bar stood
for a moment looking at his visitor. Joslin was sitting
now at the table, the glass of liquor close at hand.</p>

<p>“If you’re going to read,” said he, “you’ll have to
have a light&mdash;I’ll leave this one burning for you.” A
moment later he had passed out of his own door,
which he left unlocked. Joslin felt for him a strange
kinship, so that greater loneliness fell on him when he
had left.</p>

<p>The reek of liquor was still in the air, the sawdust
itself was redolent of it. But none of this now stirred
the blood of David Joslin. Two or three times he
raised the half-full glass in front of him level with
his eye&mdash;and placed it back again untasted on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
table. At last, quietly, pale, he took from his coat
pocket a heavy volume, which often he had carried
there.</p>

<p>There were certain worn places where the book fell
open readily. Familiar words stared up at him.</p>

<p>The solitary reader, trained to literal interpretations,
pondered what he read. He endeavored to restore the
vision of the Garden, the first home of Man. He
undertook to conceive the Temptation, to picture the
Serpent himself; indeed, tried to think as John Calvin
thought when he wrote his words:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">But, since it could not have been a trivial offense, but
must have been a detestable crime, that was so severely
punished by God, we must consider the nature of Adam’s
sin, which kindled the dreadful flame of divine wrath
against the whole human race.</p>

<p>Augustine properly observes, that pride was the first
of all evils. But we may obtain a more complete definition
from the nature of the temptation as described
by Moses. For as the Woman, by the subtlety of the
Serpent, was seduced to discredit the word of God, it is
evident that the fall commenced in disobedience. This
is also confirmed by Paul, who states that all men were
ruined by the disobedience of one.</p>

<p>With propriety, therefore, Bernard teaches that the
gate of salvation is opened to us, when in the present
day we receive the Gospel with our ears, as death was
once admitted at the same doors when they lay open to
Satan.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Augustine? Bernard? Who were they? Dust and
forgotten for the most part. But after them and before
them men had lived, human beings, hoping, aspiring,
falling, sinning. David Joslin, mountaineer,
turned once more to the pages of the old dogmatist.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">This is that hereditary corruption which the fathers
called <i>original sin</i>; meaning by sin, the depravation of a
nature previously good and pure; on which subject they
had much contention. Yet this timidity could not prevent
Pelagius from arising, who profanely pretended that
the sin of Adam only ruined himself, and did not injure
his descendants. But the temerity of the Pelagians and
Celestians will not appear surprising to him who perceives
from the writings of Augustine what a want of
modesty they discover in everything else.</p>

<p>Every descendant from the impure source is born infected
with the contagion of sin; and even before we
behold the light of life, we are in the sight of God defiled
and polluted. For “who can bring a clean thing out of
an unclean?” The Book of Job tells us, “Not one.”</p>

<p>We have heard that the impurity of the parents is so
transmitted to the children that all, without a single exception,
are polluted as soon as they exist. But we shall
not find the origin of this pollution, unless we ascend to
the first parent of us all, as to the fountain which sends
forth all the streams. Thus it is certain that Adam was
not only the progenitor, but as it were the root of mankind,
and therefore, that all the race were necessarily
vitiated in his corruption. What cavil will the Pelagians
raise here?</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">And then John Calvin went on to tell David Joslin,
sitting here in the saloon of John Moran, what sin
was:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Wherefore, Augustine, though he frequently calls it
the sin of another, the more clearly to indicate its transmission
to us by propagation, yet, at the same time, also
asserts it properly to belong to every individual. And
the apostle himself expressly declares, that “death has
therefore passed upon all men, for that all have sinned;”
that is, have been involved in original sin, and defiled with
its blemishes. And therefore infants themselves, as they
bring their condemnation into the world with them, are
rendered obnoxious to punishment by their own sinfulness,
not by the sinfulness of another. For though they
have not yet produced the fruits of their iniquity, yet
they have the seed of it within them.</p>

<p>When arguing respecting corrupt nature, Paul not only
condemns the inordinate motions of the appetites, but
principally insists on the blindness of the mind and the
depravity of the heart; and the third chapter of his
Epistle to the Romans is nothing but a description of
original sin.</p>

<p>We say, therefore, that man is corrupted by a natural
depravity. Thus vanishes the foolish and nugatory system
of the Manichæans who, having imagined in man a
substantial wickedness, presumed to invent for him a
new Creator, that they might not appear to assign the
cause and origin of evil to a righteous God.</p></div>

<p class="p1">The dour words of the savage old doctrinaire looked
up familiarly to David Joslin. More than once alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
he had pondered upon the cavilings of the Pelagians,
the deeds of the Manichæans, the Celestians, and others
who had fallen under the invectives of this stern
leader of the past. Once they had seemed adequate
to him. That very day they would have seemed adequate
to him. But not to-night.</p>

<p>Two years ago he had closed the pages of his own
past. Now he knew that he was closing the book upon
yet another stage of his own development. Fellowship,
understanding, sympathy, the common human
struggles! From John Calvin’s interpretation David
Joslin turned to an interpretation of his own. He read
from larger pages.</p>

<p>The night passed at length. Dawn grayed the dull
windows of the saloon front, opaqued that passers-by
might not see what went on within. But this dull
dawn was the opening of a new horizon to David Joslin.
He saw a wider world. He had learned that
dogma is not life.</p>

<p>He heard the door open. The owner of the place
entered, his usually impassive face curiously turned
toward the interior. Joslin walked forward to meet
him, on his face now at least the semblance of a smile.
John Moran himself smiled, as he looked and saw the
untouched glass upon the table.</p>

<p>“Well, friend, you’ve won,” said he. “Here’s your
quarter back again.”</p>

<p>Joslin felt in his hand the weight of a gold piece, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
he put it back, his lip somewhat trembling. “I thank
you,” said he, “but I can’t take it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you need it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But I’ll have to finish my own way, I reckon,”
said David Joslin. “You see, I’ve been going to school
up North here. But now I’ve concluded not to go there
any more. No&mdash;I don’t need it.”</p>

<p>He smiled now, as he extended his hand with that
quality upon his face which brought friends to him so
quickly, and held them so staunchly.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” said he, clasping his brother’s hand in
his own large one. “I thank you more than I can tell
you. I’m better than when I came in here last night.
You’ve been a good Samaritan.”</p>

<p>And so David Joslin passed out into a larger world
and a wider dawn.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE CITY ON THE HILL</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IN THE Cumberlands, at the Forks of the Kentucky
life went on as it had from time immemorial.
There were few more houses than there had been
a hundred years ago, no more roads, little more of civilization.
But one morning, while yet the dawn was
young, a man standing contemplatively on the stoop
of his house, hands in pockets, looked idly up to the
summit of the tall hill, which dominated the little town,
and the gaze of this man lingered. There seemed to
be someone up there, so far away that he could not be
identified.</p>

<p>A certain mild interest arose in the observer’s mind.
The figure yonder moved about slowly, rising and
stooping curiously. Now and again it disappeared behind
the crown of the hill. Then it would return,
slowly, stooped as though carrying some heavy burden,
would drop that burden and start back again.</p>

<p>It was Old Granny Williams who took down the
first authentic word regarding the strange work of
the man on the hilltop&mdash;she had gone up to take him
something to eat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hit’s Davy!” said she. “He’s done come back
home! He’s a-startin’ of his collidge. He war a-layin’
the stones in rows, this way and that. He done dug a
long sort of trench, like, whar the ground was level,
up on top of the hill. He shore air a-goin’ to build
something.”</p>

<p>Some scoffed at all this. Others looked up still more
curiously all that day. Word passed that David Joslin
had come back home to stay. The next day, at
about ten in the morning, as David Joslin dropped in
its place a heavy slab of sandstone, which he had carried
in his hands from his quarry on the hillside,
he looked up to see the cause of a shadow on the
ground.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Absalom,” said he quietly.</p>

<p>Absalom Gannt said nothing at first, but laid off his
coat.</p>

<p>“Damn <i>me</i>, Davy!” said he. “Hit hain’t nuvver
goin’ to be said that no Joslin could do more’n a
Gannt. Ye a-workin’ up here all alone!”</p>

<p>The grizzled old man stood for a time, hands on
hips, and looked about him.</p>

<p>“What’s that blood on that rock yander?” he asked,
pointing to a stain on the slabs at the corner.</p>

<p>“I mashed my hand between a couple of rocks,” said
David. He held up his hand. The edge of the palm,
livid and dark blue, had been bruised off in a large
half-open wound, from which the blood still oozed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
slowly. “It’s nothing,” said he. “I swore&mdash;before I
thought. It’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any tool except this old piece of crowbar,”
he went on. “Dan Bagsley, down at the shop,
put a edge on this iron. I managed to quarry some
rock with it on the face of the hill yonder.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be damned!” remarked Absalom quietly,
and, having so expressed himself, he did not fall to
work, but set off down the hill without further comment.</p>

<p>Joslin sat down to rest on the corner stone, which,
with his own hands, he had laid. The blood oozing
from his hand still further stained the rock, the color
spreading slowly as he sat. Under the corner stone
lay something else of the life of David Joslin.</p>

<p>He had buried here the old book of John Calvin, outlived
of late, since he had found that religion and
democracy, and, indeed, hope itself, are naught but
human sympathy and human understanding. Between
the leaves of the fierce old pragmatist’s volume there
lay the photograph of a woman&mdash;a little picture Joslin
himself had bought one day in a shop; the picture
of a woman with large eyes, dark, curling hair, a smile
upon her lips, as she leaned her face upon her folded
hands. Joslin was putting away the past, not regretfully,
not longingly, but reverently. The cornerstone
was a milestone for him&mdash;one of the greatest of his
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>After a time men came, old Absalom Gannt at their
head. They spoke little, nor expressed any surprise;
nor did Joslin’s mountain reticence much relax at first
He only said, quietly, that now he had come home to
build his school.</p>

<p>There were teams&mdash;two mule teams, a wagon, a
plough. Some bore hammers, others spades or axes.
More than a dozen strong they were, and as he looked
at them Joslin saw among them men of his own kin,
and men who but now had been his enemies.</p>

<p>Some now extended the excavation along the line
where Joslin already had pegged out the course of his
foundation. Others opened more fully the vein of
sandstone at the other side of the hill. The wagons
carried loads of rock now around the crest. This rock
they laid with no great skill, but steadily and soundly,
into the rude continuance of the foundation, which
presently began to outline itself definitely and surely.</p>

<p>It was to be a building far larger than any of these
men had ever seen; but, as one said to the other, Davy
had been Outside, so he would know. And David himself,
sitting now and again, somewhat wearily, on his
bloody cornerstone, looked at this advancement of his
labors and was content.</p>

<p>Toward evening of the day when they had finished
the foundation, Joslin called his band of workmen together.</p>

<p>“Friends,” said he, “we have begun. There will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
no more feuds in these mountains. This is your school
as much as mine&mdash;I don’t deserve the credit for it any
more than you-all do.”</p>

<p>The steady warmth and trust of their friendship
came all about his heart now. After all, they were his
people. All they ever had needed was a leader and a
chance.</p>

<p>He now dropped naturally and unconsciously more
or less into the vernacular that had been his, swiftly as
his own diction had changed in his two years of miraculously
hard work.</p>

<p>“We hain’t been a part of our own state so far,”
said he, “but we’re a-goin’ to be. Now we’ve got to
have papers from our state&mdash;a charter&mdash;afore we kin
run our school. We’ll call it the Cumberland Institute,
I reckon. Here’s our application fer it. I want
each of you men to sign this paper. We’ll be the
trustees. Hit’s right we should be, because we started
this work all by ourselves, with the help of the Lord.</p>

<p>“Absalom,” said he, turning to the old leader of
the clan of Gannts, “I want ye to sign yore name right
here. I’ve signed it first&mdash;I took that liberty. Sign
here, Absalom.”</p>

<p>The old man stood, his jaws working hard under his
dense gray beard. “Davy,” said he gently, “ye know I
kain’t read or write.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” said Joslin. “I’ve put yore name down
fer ye, Absalom. Make yore mark. That’ll stand just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the same. There’s fifteen of us here, and we’ll all put
our names down. We’ve been plumb forgot, here in
the Cumberlands. This will show that we asked our
state to accept us and our work.”</p>

<p>“You, Chan,” said he, nodding to the next man,
“come and sign.” And Chan came and signed as Absalom
had signed&mdash;making his mark. And the others
followed, each taking in his hand the bit of pencil.
Of the fifteen of them only three could write their
names. And those names, thus written, stand to-day,
in reproach to one of the proudest states in the Union.</p>

<p>As one of the workmen expressed it, “things sort of
begun to drift in, like.” Material arrived, and men
to handle it. Women now brought up meals. So
strangely animated did the men become that they
grudged the time spent even in their eating, nor did
the hours of daylight seem long enough for them.
Some found that shavings made an excellent bed for
the night. They slept sometimes in the shavings for
mattress, with their coats for covering.</p>

<p>Thus in time there arose, gaunt against the skyline,
the frame of the first college building in the Cumberlands.
A sober, steady, quiet plebiscite went on. The
entire population of the village was engaged. Many
folk from the country around about came in. None
asked questions. The common thing was for a man to
arrive, and to lay off his coat. The least was said, and
all was mended among these. The work of one strong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
faith-keeping man had been done. There was not a
weapon on the hill.</p>

<p>Slowly, with incredible toil, the unskilled hands of
these unpaid laborers advanced the task which they
had set for themselves. Still the building extended itself
against the skyline. About the bottom of the walls
now slowly arose the covering of rough-hewn boards,
so that it was more apparent what the finished structure
would be, if ever it might be finished. The hill
folk marveled at the vast size of this building, wondering
at Davy Joslin when he told them there were
yet larger in the world outside.</p>

<p>Joslin worked steadily with the others, growing
gaunter and gaunter as the weeks passed. A faint line
of gray had come at his temples, though he yet was
young. He had driven body and mind alike without
mercy these last years.</p>

<p>None the less, in these surroundings so familiar,
among these friends so simple and sincere in their confidence,
the soul of the man, so long sad and dour,
began to thaw, to show itself beneath the wintry aspect
of a nature wholly absorbed in a compelling purpose.
To his lips came now more often the light jest,
the grim quip, the merry retort, which once had marked
him as a younger man. Day by day, not unsettling
himself in the new respect in which they held him for
his wider experience, he grew into, or fell back into,
the old ways of the earlier days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>At times when the work was done for the day and
dusk had fallen, they would light a lamp in one of
the more sheltered rooms of the unfinished building,
and Joslin would read to them for an hour or so, explaining
to them what he had read, telling them of the
greater world of thought and activity in affairs, which
lay beyond their knowledge, and thus proving to them
all the better the need of this work in which they were
engaged. No Homer of old was ever more a god to
his listeners than David Joslin here in the rude structure
of his unfinished building.</p>

<p>Again, a yet lighter side of the nature of the mountain
man would manifest itself&mdash;few, indeed, were
more human than himself at heart. With a wide
smile, upon occasion, he might call a halt in the labors
for a time, and, taking from under a board the new
violin, which represented his sole acquisition in the
outer world from which he now had exiled himself in
turn, he would motion to them to clear a space upon
the floor, and fall to dancing for his playing. For the
time, the natural fervor of the mountain soul would
forget itself in the ancient relaxation of their kind,
and men and women, or even children, would follow
the measure of his bow. He played with a certain
native skill, if with unfinished art, but knowing well
the power of music as incentive and as stimulus.
These matters now strengthened him in the regard of
his fellows, so that he became a leader indeed, not of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
one clan, but of many, of all. His word was law to
them now. Had he cared to preach, he could, indeed,
have stood before them now, and swayed them with
his words. But David Joslin did not preach.</p>

<p>It was thus that the city grew, and thus that the
feuds passed, no man might say when. There had come
from among the people, as always there does come in
time of need, a man who had learned and lived, had
joyed and sorrowed with them, and who, therefore,
was fit to lead them, and to speak with the tongue of
law and of prophecy. Alone, Joslin was wide-eyed
and sorrowing, as any man must be who carries burdens
other than his own. Unconsciously, he was learning
the great truth that human sympathy is the only
foundation for human leadership.</p>

<p>“Fer a man who kin read the way he kin, four syllerbles
and all, Davy hain’t stuck up none at all,” said
old Absalom Gannt. “No, I reckon he’s all right. He
hain’t changed a bit inside.”</p>

<p>“He kin play the fiddle yit, too,” assented Chan Bullock.
“I dunno as old Levi Gaines kin play ‘Turkey
in the Straw’ any better than what Davy does, an’
Levi’s been allowed to be e’en about the best fiddler in
these parts fer nigh on to forty year.”</p>

<p>“That’s a heap older than Davy is, no matter how
he looks,” said Absalom. “I re-colleck when he was
borned all right, an’ he hain’t thirty yit. I’ll say he’s
a right servigerous man, young as he is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” explained Chan Bullock, resting his hands
for the time on the top of his mattock handle. “While
he may have been a heap like the rest of us one way of
speakin’, Davy hain’t never been profligate. If he had
been, I don’t reckon he’d of been called.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="pch">THESE TWAIN</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">ONE day, without explanation to his fellows,
Joslin ceased in his labors, and started down
the hill. No one asked him his intention, for
he rarely spoke of his own plans. They saw his tall
figure passing by the road beyond the forks of the
river&mdash;the direction of his home. A half-hour before
dusk that day, he arrived at the little gap in the fence,
which made the gate of his own scant acres, unvisited
for two years.</p>

<p>He walked steadily up to his own door, and, without
announcement, pushed it open.</p>

<p>Two women stared at him without speech, as he
stood in the half-light. One of these was his wife,
the other his grandmother&mdash;the latter had come in
upon one of her not infrequent visits, for in the Cumberlands
kinship is held a sacred thing, and the ravens
of the Lord have never forgotten their ancient errand.</p>

<p>Old Granny Joslin was the first to speak. “Well,
Davy?” said she, as though she had been expecting
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not answer her, did not bend in token of
greeting to the other woman who sat sullenly silent.
He took his own place at the fireside&mdash;the chief’s place
of counsel in a cabin home. It once had been his own
fireside. He was a stranger here to-day.</p>

<p>He stared silently at the ashes after the fashion of
the mountaineers, who mostly do so because they have
few thoughts. But David Joslin had many thoughts
now, riotous thoughts, that left his mind a scene of
combat.</p>

<p>This squalid interior, the unmade bed, the grimy
pillow coverings, the table littered with the dishes of
the earlier meal, the entire lack of neatness, cleanliness
and order that left the place a hovel, and not a home&mdash;all
this was as when he had left the place. There
arose for him the comparison of this with the sweet
quiet of other homes.</p>

<p>He had the feeling that gaunt fingers were reaching
out to claim him once more. These who sat here&mdash;they
were flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone. They
were his people. He was of them. What, then, was
his duty? And why could he not set out of his mind
the comparison that urged in upon him&mdash;of these with
others whom he had seen in a wider and lovelier world
than this? These were ignorant as once he had been&mdash;caught
in the shallows of life, victims of dwarfing
poverty all their days.</p>

<p>Of these two was one whom David Joslin had sworn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
to love, honor and cherish, cleaving to none other. He
had lived after the fashion of his people. Corn bread
and hog meat; pot hooks and the early bed for the
woman, crops and the occasional “frolic” for the man&mdash;that
was the life all of them had known. This might
have been any home; this woman, any wife of these
hills. But other pictures rose before him&mdash;before
David Joslin, a man with a conscience and a will
to do the right.</p>

<p>Joslin shifted in his chair, but there was no greeting
in his gaze. He did not reach out his hand to touch
that of his wife&mdash;indeed, he never would have done
that in the presence of another, for that would have
been in violation of the creed of the hills.</p>

<p>“Well, Meliss’,” said he at last, “I’ve come back.”</p>

<p>“I see ye hev,” said she. “Hit’s nigh about time ye
did.”</p>

<p>“That may be. At least I’m here.”</p>

<p>“We heerd tell of ye, Davy,” said his grandmother.
“We heerd tell all about what’s happened. I don’t
reckon folks’ll laugh at ye no more. How far along
is the big house by now, Davy?”</p>

<p>“The walls are up, Granny,” said he. “It looks
right fine, up on top of the hill. We’re out of nails
now&mdash;I’ve got to go down the river before long to see
if I can get trusted for a keg of nails at Windsor.”
The corners of his mouth suggested a grim smile.</p>

<p>“Ye’d better see if ye kain’t git trusted fer a sack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
of meal,” sneered his wife. “How ye suppose we-all
was a-goin’ to live here? Hit’s two year sence ye
left.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t suppose, Meliss’,” said he. “If I had supposed
anything at all I’d have stayed right here. When
a thing has got to be done, you can’t look at what lies
between you and it.”</p>

<p>“Ye’re a fine preacher o’ the Gospel,” said she contemptuously.</p>

<p>“I’m not a preacher of the Gospel,” replied David
Joslin quietly.</p>

<p>“How come ye hain’t, Davy?” demanded his granddam.
“I done tolt everybody ye was called. How
come ye hain’t a preacher? If ye was, that explains a
heap of things. Preachers, they hain’t held responserble.”</p>

<p>“It’s not yet time, Granny,” said Joslin gently.
“Some time, maybe. I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Not time! When’s it a-goin’ to be time then?
When yore pap beginned to preach, he jest up an’
beginned, that’s all, an’ he was helt as powerful a
preacher as ary in these mountings. Don’t I mind
how over on the Buffalo he preached fer two weeks
without a showin’ o’ grace, an’ he kep’ right on, an’
come evenin’ of the fourteenth day things begun fer to
break, an’ within the next two days he baptized over
two hundred souls, tell he taken a chill an’ liken enough
to die from it, excusin’ the quinine I gin him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Joslin, “I know about that. But if I
don’t preach there, someone else will.”</p>

<p>“Well, what then?” demanded the fierce old woman
of him. “What’s the matter with ye, boy? Hain’t ye
as good a man as yore daddy, or air ye made all of
skim melk?”</p>

<p>He only shook his head, and tried to smile.</p>

<p>“Ye’re a-workin’ right alongside of them Gannts
up thar, they tell me,” went on the old dame. “Hit
don’t look to me like ye had sand enough to hurt a
flea. Why hain’t ye killed old Absalom long afore
this? My Lord, looks to me like ye’d had chancet
enough! Did ye come back fer yore pistol?”</p>

<p>“No, Granny, I didn’t come back for my pistol.”</p>

<p>“If ye don’t kill that man I’ll do it myself some
time!” exclaimed the old woman savagely. “I hain’t
a-skeered to do it, if ye air. An’ look at Chan Bullock&mdash;he’s
all the leader the Joslins has got now, sence
ye turned tail an’ run out. He’s a-workin’ now, too,
along with the Gannts&mdash;well, maybe he’s only waitin’
to git a good chancet. Maybe he’ll git old Absalom yit
some time.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he will,” said David Joslin quietly.
“They’ve slept side by side for more than one night,
and neither made a move. Neither of them had a
gun&mdash;there’s not a pistol in the whole lot.”</p>

<p>“Well, couldn’t Chan taken a hammer and mashed
him while he was asleep?” demanded the old woman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
“What better chancet will he ever hev than he’s got
right now? Did them people ever give us ary chancet,
I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>“No; nor did we them until now, Granny. But that
day’s gone by.”</p>

<p>“Don’t ye be too damn sure,” reiterated the fiery old
dame. “They’ll git ye yit, ef ye don’t watch out.”</p>

<p>“If they do,” said Joslin, “I’m ready to go. I tell
you, times have changed in these hills.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” began his wife again. “Ye’re takin’ a heap
on yoreself, seems to me, Davy Joslin. I reckon ye
think ye done all this&mdash;in two year!”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think so, Meliss’. I think the Lord
did it.”</p>

<p>“And yet ye hain’t set up fer preachin’ yit! How’d
ye come through school, anyhow? I’ll bet ye’re pore
as Job’s turkey right now.”</p>

<p>“I’m worse than that, Meliss’. I’ve got nothing.”</p>

<p>“That’s it! That’s right!” went on his wife heatedly.
“Hit’s what I expected. Ye’d let us starve.
Well, I’ll fix ye anyhow.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Meliss’?” asked David Joslin
curiously. Under his words now, gentle as they were,
was the fierceness of the mountaineer, jealous of any
liberties taken with him.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, “ye quit me. Ye done left me
fer full two year.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t, Meliss’. I didn’t quit you for two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
years. I told you when I left it was for all my life.”</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ that throwed her on my hands,” growled
Granny Joslin. “Still, I wouldn’t complain if it hadn’t
been them Gannts stole eight or ten hawgs off en us
last year.”</p>

<p>“Hit was a fine way to do,” went on his wife, with
growing confidence in her own powers now. “I nuvver
seed a man in these mountings run away from his
wife that way, lessen he was obleeged to lay out er
git free from the law fer a while.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t leave the country,” replied David Joslin.
“I left you. That don’t mean that I’ve left any of my
responsibilities. I told you I didn’t dare look at the
things I ought to do&mdash;it was only a question of the
thing I ought to do the most. I had to get my education
first. Now I’ve come back. I want to see now
what I’d best to do about you.”</p>

<p>“Fine time to begin plannin’ now!” rejoined his
wife sullenly.</p>

<p>“It’s true,” said he, “I can’t do much. I’ve got
mighty little to do with. Still, I want to pay my
debts.”</p>

<p>She rose and stood before him, close to his chair,
her hands clenched into fists, her eyes flashing.</p>

<p>“Dang ye!” said she, with all the fury of the woman
scorned in her face. “Ye quit me yellow, that’s what
ye did. Ye run away an’ left me&mdash;ye was a coward&mdash;ye
was a-skeered to stay in here&mdash;an’ now ye want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
come sneakin’ around, tryin’ to make peace with them
Gannts that we fit with all our lives, the hull of our
fam’ly agin the hull of theirn! Ye come a-crawlin’ in
here atter dark, an’ talkin’ to me about plans! Ye
say the Lord has been a-holpin’ ye. I don’t reckon the
Lord had much to do with it. I reckon ye could tell
a-plenty different story right now if ye wanted to.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said David Joslin, his forehead wet now, “I
could.”</p>

<p>“Ye act to me like a houn’,” said she. “If ye’d been
ary part of a man ye wouldn’t of runned away an’ lef
me.”</p>

<p>“David, I reckon ye got to call that kind of talk,”
said the old woman quietly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Granny,” said he, “I reckon I must.” But
yet he sat silent, while his wife, now lashed into a fury,
reviled him in such words as need not be repeated.
Granny Joslin sat and chuckled ghoulishly, her pipe between
her toothless lips.</p>

<p>“Well, go on, Meliss’,” said she. “Ye’re a-gettin’
ready for a trouncin’, ‘pears to me. Hain’t no Joslin’ll
take that.”</p>

<p>But presently her grim face turned to the man who
sat there silent, staring into the ashes of the fire.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with ye, boy?” said she. “<i>Air</i>
ye quittin’? Tell me&mdash;have ye been actin’ up with ary
other womern Outside? If ye hain’t, it’s time ye tuk
an’ taken a hand now in yore own house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>“Granny,” said David Joslin suddenly, his face white
in his resolution for a “true confession and not a false
defense,” “there are three women in my life. Meliss’
here is one. There were two others&mdash;Outside. If
you’d mean that I’ve gone wrong&mdash;for always&mdash;with
either, or any other woman in the world, that’s not
true. I came here to tell you the truth. What I’ve
done you know&mdash;as much as you’re big enough to
know or understand, Meliss’. Now, what do you
mean? You say you’ve fixed me&mdash;what do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“As though I was a-goin’ to keep on standin’ it!”
half screamed his wife. “I tell ye I’m through with
ye as much as ye air with me. That new doctor filled
yore mind with notions about our bein’ married. Well,
all right!”</p>

<p>“Yes, he did. It was wrong that we ever should
have been married. But I’ve ended that as far as I
could. I studied over it for a long time. What’s
right for me to do? Whatever it is, I want to do it.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t need to study so much fer my own part,”
retorted she. “Thar’s lawyers as well as doctors comin’
in this way nowadays. Well, I’m a-goin’ to git me a
<i>di</i>vorce, that’s what <i>I’m</i> a-goin’ to do. I done sole
the red hawg to pay the lawyer, and he done tolt me
what to do.”</p>

<p>“Ye heerd her, Davy,” said Granny Joslin, nodding
her head. “I’ve knowed it. I was a-hopin’ ye’d give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
her a good thrashin’, though, afore she tolt ye&mdash;hit
would of been more manful if ye had. But it’s true.
She’s a-goin’ to git a <i>di</i>vorce&mdash;the fust time that word
has ever been heerd in our fam’ly.”</p>

<p>“Nor in mine neither,” rejoined the younger woman.
“We was always fitten to be married ontel the railroads
come in here&mdash;with their new doctors an’ their
new lawyers. I’ve been mocked here in these mountings
because my man left me, an’ because I didn’t
have no fam’ly. Well, I said I fixed it. I’ve got out
the papers.”</p>

<p>“But there was no law against cousins marrying in
this state,” said Joslin. “It was only a natural law
we broke&mdash;that’s the pity of it all, and the awful part
of it all.”</p>

<p>“If thar was law agin hit thar’d be a heap of marriages
ontied in these mountings,” said Granny Joslin.</p>

<p>“Hit don’t need to be that,” expounded Meliss’.
“The lawyer done tolt me, if a man done lef’ his wife
fer two year ‘thouten no support, she could git a
<i>di</i>vorce from him. Well, ye lef’ me two year ago&mdash;ye
jest been a-hintin’ at something of yore goin’s on
fer two year. Live with ye?&mdash;Not if ye was the last
man on airth! I’m done&mdash;I’m a-goin’ to be free.”</p>

<p>“You’ve different ideas from what I had,” said
David Joslin, still quietly. “I only thought it wasn’t
right for us to live together. I wasn’t thinking of
shirking any duty, or breaking any promise, least of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
all my marriage promise. I was going to pay you
all I owed&mdash;all I could in every way.”</p>

<p>“Ye kain’t pay me nothin’ an’ nohow!” stormed his
wife. “I don’t need ye noways on airth!”</p>

<p>“I’ve got mighty little in the world,” went on Joslin
whitely after a time. “I’ll deed you the farm here.
I never asked you to do what you’ve done&mdash;divorce is
a thing unknown in our family or in these hills. But
one thing’s sure&mdash;not for any reason&mdash;not even if
the first reason was taken away&mdash;could I go on living
with you now.”</p>

<p>Trembling in her rage at this, the first actual slight
he had put upon her, his wife rose and half ran from
the room, deeds, speech and even tears denied her.
Joslin made no motion to restrain her, nor did the
old dame, chuckling over her pipe, even follow her
with her eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s done, Granny,” said Joslin bitterly after a time.
“She can do what she likes about marrying again&mdash;I’ll
not raise a hand to help her or stop her. What
I have is hers, all of it, and that’s all I can do. As
for me, I’ve not got a dollar, and I never will have
while I live, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Thar!” exulted the old woman. “I fotched it! I
knowed it&mdash;I knowed thar was a other womern&mdash;but
<i>two</i>! Tell me all about it, Davy. Furriners, huh?
Well, I must say, Davy, that’s more <i>like</i>&mdash;that’s more
like ye had some sort of a <i>man</i>-sperrit left to ye!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Her shrill laughter now filled the room, and swayed
her gnarled form as she rocked to and fro, her pipe
involuntarily falling from her mouth in her merriment
“Tell me about ‘em.”</p>

<p>“One was a married woman,” said David Joslin,
speaking freely before his grandmother as he could
not have done before his wife. “I didn’t know how
fine and steady and sweet a woman could be till I
saw her. I never heard her say a word above her
voice. She was fine, always. I reckon she gave me
my start&mdash;she showed what there was to hope and
work for in the world. And she was beautiful, too&mdash;in
a way I can’t well describe. She was so quiet, so
still, folks never would think she was much, maybe
not even beautiful. She’s one worth more than the
world’s estimate. There are such&mdash;the finest of all in
all the world, in all its days. She’s married.”</p>

<p>“Go on, Davy,” chuckled the old dame. “Tell the
rest&mdash;tell about the <i>other</i> furrin womern. Ye said thar
was <i>two</i> on ‘em. That’s some sperrit, boy! I declar,
I’m a-thinkin’ more of ye now than I done hafe a hour
ago! While ye’re confessin’, come on through an’ tell
me the hull story. Was this-un old or young&mdash;was
she married or single?”</p>

<p>“Single,” said David Joslin, still staring into the
fire; “and young.”</p>

<p>“What manner of gal was <i>she</i>? Was she purty?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think any woman ever could be so beautiful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
in one way,” said Joslin soberly and truthfully.
He raised his eyes now and looked fair into the face of
his granddam.</p>

<p>The old woman shrilled with laughter as she saw
the pallor of his cheek&mdash;the laughter of the old at the
ways of life gone by. “Go on, Davy!” said she.
“What sort of lookin’ gal was <i>she</i>? Tell me now&mdash;was
she big or little&mdash;dark or fair?”</p>

<p>“She would just about go under my arm if I stood
up,” said David Joslin slowly. “She was dark&mdash;her
hair and eyes both dark. She told me she was French
and Irish&mdash;she came from Boston, so she said.”</p>

<p>“French and Irish&mdash;oh, my God!” exclaimed the
old dame. “Same as <i>myself</i>! Law sakes, Meliss’,”
she shrilled through the half-open door beyond&mdash;
“could you a-blame him? Didn’t I know his daddy,
an’ don’t I know him? Don’t I know <i>ary</i> man, come
to that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, Davy,” she added at last, “when air ye
a-goin’ to leave us and go on back Outside? I reckon
<i>that’s</i> the one ye’re a-goin’ back to, huh?”</p>

<p>“I’ll never see her again, Granny,” said David Joslin
quietly. “But&mdash;now you ask me why I’m not a
preacher&mdash;that’s why.”</p>

<p>Silence fell now in the little cabin, so agonized was
he. The old woman nodded her head slowly.</p>

<p>“I’m going away now, Granny,” he continued at
last “I’ve hurt Meliss’ mightily, and I’m sorry. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
sinned, and I was to blame for it, not she, and I know
that clear enough&mdash;she didn’t know any better. I’ve
made nothing but trouble all my life, for myself most
of all. Sometimes it’s hard to stand.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Davy,” said his old granddam, nodding.
“Yore way is a-goin’ to be right hard, I kin see
that. Ye got a heap of troubles, one thing with another.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said he after a time. “It’s no use my
hanging around. I’m going back.”</p>

<p>“Goin’ back!” shrilled the old dame, in her toothless
mirthfulness. “We’ll look fer ye some day&mdash;but
ye go on back now to that other womern. French-Irish!&mdash;she’ll
be givin’ ye the slip if ye don’t watch
out!”</p>

<p>“I’m not going back to her,” said David Joslin.
“I told you that was done. I’m not coming back here,
either.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” commented his wrinkled ancestress. “Here
ye was with <i>three</i> wimmern on yore hands afore ye
was thirty year old&mdash;Meliss’ an’ them two others!
Well, I’ve heerd tell of mounting boys that has went
Outside an’ made their fortunes an’ come back.&mdash;Ye
been right busy, one way of speakin’.”</p>

<p>Her grandson only stared at her, mute.</p>

<p>“As fer Meliss’,” she added maliciously, “the Lord
has gave an’ the law has took away. I don’t put it
a-past her to marry agin&mdash;the lawyer man tolt her she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
could if she liked an’ could find ary man’d take her.
She’s powerful homely now.”</p>

<p>Granny Joslin filled her pipe and went on smoking
and chuckling. She stared so steadily into the ashes
of the fireplace, was so deeply engaged with her own
self-communings, that she scarcely noticed her grandson
as he pushed back his chair, arising.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Davy,” said she, as he reached the
threshold.</p>

<p>He turned from her and once more closed the door.
It was his door no more.</p>

<p>“Meliss’,” said the old woman when at length she
heard no more his feet passing on the hard ground
walk. “Come on back in. He’s done gone.”</p>

<p>“What did I say!” broke out the younger woman as
she clumped in once more. She flung herself into a
chair, her face distorted with her jealous anger. “I
knowed it&mdash;I knowed it all along. I knowed he’d be
a-carryin’ on with wimmern-folks outside&mdash;he done
owned up to two&mdash;ye heerd him, didn’t ye? Us
a-starvin’ here, an’ him livin’ soft with them rich!
Well, I fixed him, an’ I’m glad of it&mdash;he had it a-comin’
to him, that’s one thing shore.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Granny Joslin after a time, “hit don’t
look to me like thar was much hope; that’s right.”</p>

<p>“Hope!” half screamed the other, unrestrained. “I
don’t want no hope. If he quits me, I reckon I’ve quit
him. I hain’t so old, come to that. I kin raise my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
fam’ly yit, somewhars else. Thar’s other men in the
world besides him&mdash;an’ real men at that.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Meliss’?” said the old woman,
quietly. “You’ve said that twict now. I know the
Joslins. He hain’t nuvver comin’ back agin&mdash;not in
all his hull life. He’s done. He’ll have enough trouble&mdash;but
he’ll nuvver trouble ye agin. He’s <i>gone</i>.”</p>

<p>“All right, then,” retorted the other angrily. “Let
him go. He’s been gone fer two year, an’ he mought
as well have been gone fer another year afore that.
What do I need with him, with all the other men thar
is in the world?”</p>

<p>“Huh!” rejoined the old lady, “as though I didn’t
know ye’d been a-carryin’ on a civil courtship already!
Seen him lately, Meliss’? ‘Pears to me like ye git
worse favored every year, Meliss’. Ye’re a powerful
homely womern, like I done tolt Davy now.” She still
chuckled savagely, fearless as ever.</p>

<p>“Go on home!” cried the irate woman who faced
her. “I hate ye all, ye Andy Joslins. Who air ye,
anyways, to put on sech airs with me?”</p>

<p>But Granny Joslin did not go home for yet a while.
Instead, she lighted her pipe with a coal once more,
pushing it down with a horny forefinger.</p>

<p>“To <i>dance</i> through life, Meliss’,” said she, after a
time, apropos of nothing apparent,&mdash;“that’s what life
is fer. Ye set mopin’ and dawncey all the time&mdash;sour
as a last month’s cornpone&mdash;do ye expect a man’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
a-goin’ to love ye fer that? Yore old one didn’t, an’
yore new one won’t. But me&mdash;I kin dance yit!”</p>

<p>And suiting the action to the word, the old dame
did arise, and catching her scant skirts up in either
hand, executed a sturdy jig after the fashion of the
olden times, stamping out the time on the puncheon
floor, with an occasional exclamation of her own,
whirling and turning, and now and then extending
her skirts, at last snapping her fingers as she ceased.
She seemed not too weary nor out of breath as she
sank again into her chair.</p>

<p>“My God, Meliss’,” she said, “I’m glad thar’s one
Joslin that’s showed hisself a man!”</p>

<p>She spoke to a vacant room&mdash;the other and younger
woman, gone fey of her own savage humors, once
more had flung from the room and was standing,
hands clenched, in the yard beyond. But old Granny
Joslin was not perturbed. She lighted her pipe once
more and sat for a time engaged in her own thoughts
as before&mdash;her eyes fixed exactly on a certain knot of
a certain log in the rude wall&mdash;she voiced her own
conclusions to herself.</p>

<p>“I was about that height my own self when I was
a gal. An’ Lord! hain’t it sweet&mdash;to come just inside
the arm of a strong man, Meliss’? Don’t I know?</p>

<p>“I was a-wonderin’ fer a while which one of them
two wimmern Davy’d turn up with fustest. But,
sakes! I know&mdash;he tolt me plenty, if he didn’t Meliss’.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
French-Irish&mdash;dark and curly-haired&mdash;big eyes, like
enough&mdash;she come right under his arm when he stood
up&mdash;the sort that’s sort of squushy when you hug ‘em&mdash;maybe
light on her feet&mdash;laughin’, maybe! Wimmern
that laughs has always got the aidge on them
that cries. Why, I kin see that womern dancin’ as she
goes along, alive clar down to her toes&mdash;that’s the
one&mdash;you hear me now!”</p>

<p>And having demolished all argument on the part of
the listening knot, Granny Joslin at length did knock
the last ashes from her pipe, and, rising, leave the
empty house and cold hearthfire of what was no longer
a home.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="pch">MARCIA HADDON</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">DAVID JOSLIN wished nothing so much as to
be quite alone. He did not rejoin his companions
on the hill. Pleading his errand at
Windsor, he set out at once down stream with no
companion other than his own bitter thoughts. It
seemed to him he never had known a longer or more
terrible day, nor had the future ever appeared to him
so hopeless and foredoomed.</p>

<p>It was yet daylight when he arrived at the little
town, and he turned once more to the boarding house
of the Widow Dunham. As he reached the gate he
caught the fragrance of a cigar whose aroma was
unusual in these parts. Unwilling to meet strangers,
he halted an instant; but finding no way out of it, he
advanced, an odd sort of conviction suddenly in his
mind. Sitting there, almost as they had sat two years
ago, he saw two figures, both familiar to him.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” growled the raucous voice of James
Haddon as he turned. “What, what? We meet
again! How’s this happen, stranger? Where you
been all the while?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Joslin shook the hand of each simply, without a
word.</p>

<p>Haddon was heavier, redder, yet more coarsened
by his manner of life, than when he last had seen
him. The flesh hung puffily on his cheeks, drooped
from his folded neck above his collar. His prominent
eyes were yet more prominent and bulging.</p>

<p>As for his wife, it seemed more than ever as though
she did not belong with him, as though she degraded
herself by sitting even thus close to him.</p>

<p>“We didn’t expect to see you here, Mr. Joslin,”
said Marcia Haddon&mdash;“nor anywhere else,” with a
faint smile.</p>

<p>“I always planned one day to explain to you,
Ma’am,” said Joslin. “I didn’t want you to think me
ungrateful. I may have seemed so.”</p>

<p>Marcia Haddon’s quick senses caught the increased
dignity about the man. She noted also, keenly, womanlike,
the new shade of sadness on his unsmiling face,
and wondered what was the cause.</p>

<p>But Haddon himself had no interest in these matters.
“Well,” he growled, “I’m not going to say I
was tickled to death at the way you treated us. You
double-crossed me&mdash;you threw me down, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Haddon,” said David Joslin quietly. “I did
not double-cross you. I never did that in my life to
anyone. You can’t call that to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, you didn’t go along,” rejoined Haddon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
testily. “I hate above all things the man that won’t
go along with the bunch. It knocks to pieces any
sort of business&mdash;big men go in front and plan things,
and some little fellow comes along and knocks it all
out I’ve got no patience with that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>Joslin’s pale face suddenly went white.</p>

<p>“I’ve not a dollar in my pocket now, Mr. Haddon,”
said he at last. “I didn’t have when I was in your
country. I didn’t know the ways of your country&mdash;I
was ignorant. But you don’t know the ways of my
country, and you’re ignorant, or you’d not speak that
way to me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t bring it all up again, Jim,” interposed Marcia
Haddon quickly, and raised an arm of intervention,
although Joslin had not moved. She tried to catch
her husband’s eye, for she herself knew it was not
far to trouble now. “Why, Mr. Joslin,” she went on,
“we were just talking of you and wishing we had
someone to take us in. We’re here just as we were
two years ago; and, as you say, we’re ignorant. We
don’t know this country any better now than we did
then. You say you’re not ungrateful&mdash;won’t you let
us be grateful too?”</p>

<p>“He knows what I want now,” interrupted her husband
testily. “It’s time I knew something absolute
and sure about my company’s investments in there.
Well, are you going to take me in this time, young
fellow?” he demanded brusquely of Joslin. “Let me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
tell you, I’m not going to turn back again. Are you
going to try to square it now a little by helping the
man that helped you?”</p>

<p>“If it’s any help to Mrs. Haddon to have me go in
with you, I’ll be glad,” said Joslin directly. “She has
been very good to me. I’m going back up river tomorrow
as far as the Forks.</p>

<p>“But I’ve got to be going now,” he added, and so
turned away to the street gate, so shaken with white
anger that he scarce cared where he went.</p>

<p>Haddon, mumbling, rose and went into the house,
leaving his wife alone. Not long later she heard a
giggle, a protest, a chuckle of low laughter. James
Haddon had chucked the comely Widow Dunham under
the chin, had cast an arm across her somewhat
ample shoulders.</p>

<p>“Who was that talkin’ outside?” queried the widow.</p>

<p>“Oh, that? It was that long-legged chambermaid
you had working here last year&mdash;Jucklin&mdash;Joslin&mdash;&mdash; What’s
his name? Never mind him&mdash;won’t I do? At
least I used to.”</p>

<p>The widow replied in such fashion as was obvious.
Their joint murmured, low-laughing conversation became
unescapable for the single auditor on the gallery.
At length Marcia Haddon rose. Something came upon
her on the instant, some swift, unappointed revolt, an
unspeakable disgust with the married bondage she had
so long borne unwillingly. She could not speak with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
her husband&mdash;quietly she passed the two and went
into her own room.</p>

<p>He followed her, after a time, and there she turned
upon him suddenly, her cheeks burning in two red
spots.</p>

<p>“Jim, I can’t stand this sort of thing any longer.
I can’t&mdash;I can’t&mdash;and I will not!”</p>

<p>He stood suddenly crestfallen at this sudden revolt
of one long thought so passive. She went on hurriedly.</p>

<p>“It’s gone too far. If it’s not one woman, it’s another.
It’s in your blood now&mdash;you’ve been at this
sort of thing so long you can’t stop. I’ve been ashamed
for years. How can I help knowing?”</p>

<p>“If I did, who’s to blame?” he rejoined surlily. “A
woman as cold as you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s true now, that’s true! But why should
you care? Only, I’ll not go on this way any farther.”</p>

<p>Hands in pockets, he only turned away, growling.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, back home,” she went on, her hands at
the sides of her temples, “I seemed to be able to stand
it. But here&mdash;things seem plainer, some way.”</p>

<p>His sneer had the sullen anger of a man who knows
the indefensibility of his position. “That long-legged
lout has taught you to cheek me too. Damn him!”</p>

<p>“Jim,” said she, “I don’t like to hear such things
of you. It’s not worthy of the man you used to be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
When we get back to the city we’ll have to get on some
other way. I’ll go on through with you now, because
I know your business interests are in real danger. I
won’t say anything now. But that’s all. I’m done.
This is good-by for you and me.”</p>

<p>Dumfounded, Haddon left her and went out again
into the darkness. He sat moodily, his cigar hanging
from his flabby lips. Mutiny such as this he had never
suspected as a possible thing from a woman like his
wife. There came to him, sternly facing him now,
two influences&mdash;new in his life of bluffing and jollying
and pretending and evading and deceiving&mdash;the
indomitableness of a real man and the immutability
of a real woman.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="pch">THE NARROWS</p>

<p class="drop-cap09">BY MORNING, Haddon had become a trace more
possible in his comportment. He did not
need to speak to Joslin further about the
joining of forces up the river, for the latter had his
own supplies at the landing early, ready for the embarkation,
and had arranged to send down for his
own boat at a later time. They set about their journey
in Haddon’s boat, as being more commodious and
faster. It did fairly well, the out-board motor chugging
along around bend after bend of the ancient river,
awakening echoes whose like had never before that
time been known in these hills where oar and paddle
and sweep had served immemorially.</p>

<p>At noon they ate their luncheon on a shaded bank&mdash;not
too happy a company, for Haddon was strangely
silent, his wife not less so, and Joslin himself, always
taciturn, found no reason for speech. As they re-embarked
Haddon did make some inquiry as to the
length and character of the remaining way.</p>

<p>“By and by, in four or five miles,” answered Joslin
civilly, “we’ll come to the foot of the Narrows. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
reckon we’ll have to drag the boat up through the
Narrows. Between here and there we’ll have trouble&mdash;the
water shoals out in a good many places.”</p>

<p>This last was fair prophecy, as they were to find.
It never occurred to Haddon that he could go overboard
and help in the progress of the boat when it
grounded. Joslin stepped out as he was, took the
painter of the boat across his shoulder, and, bent forward
like any beast of burden, waded on, dragging
the heavy craft behind him. Marcia Haddon sat
watching all this, looking from the one man to the
other. The patience of the poor man, the carelessness
of the rich man&mdash;these things indeed came to her soul
in the nature of a comparison. At length Haddon had
the bad taste and bad judgment to complain querulously
about the slowness of their progress.</p>

<p>“Damn it, man, is that as fast as you can go?” he
exclaimed, perhaps having in mind earlier experiences
with half-breed guides in tourist countries.</p>

<p>Joslin made no immediate reply, but stood rigid for
a time, very pale. At length, the painter of the boat
still in his hand, he waded back alongside the boat
and looked the other man in the face, his own eyes
glowing.</p>

<p>“Mr. Haddon,” said he, “get out here in the water.
If we both pull on the line, we can get this lady up
there a good deal faster.”</p>

<p>And Haddon, being wise, got out, accoutered as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
was. Joslin, somber, taciturn, did not speak to him at
all for a half-hour or more.</p>

<p>At length they came, with an hour or so yet of daylight,
to the foot of the great pool which lay below
the Narrows.</p>

<p>“Here’s where we’ll have to be careful,” said Joslin
now, as rounding the bend they caught the full roar
of the waters which had assailed their ears for so
long. Before them lay a deep black pool with a high
ridge of white running down the middle. Above the
pool a transverse bar of white entirely crossed the
river, here pinched down between two rock walls.
The stream plunged across a broken reef, dropping
some feet in a wide cascade. On either side were flat
ledges of rock now exposed above the water. Obviously,
it was the intention of Joslin to walk alongside
and drag up the boat close to the shore.</p>

<p>“How far is it on from here?” demanded Haddon,
sullenly. “It’s one hell of a looking spot, ain’t it,
you’ve brought us to&mdash;black already as though it was
night! I never did like water anyway.”</p>

<p>“There’s a short cut across the hills from here to
town&mdash;only a few miles,” Joslin answered quietly.
“We can make good time once we get above here.”</p>

<p>“It’s a mighty bad-looking place,” grumbled Haddon.
“I don’t like the looks of it at all. How are you
ever going to get up through there?”</p>

<p>“It’s easy,” said Joslin. “I’ve been through a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
times, I reckon. I’ll take care of you, so don’t
be afraid. Now, when I run alongside the ledge yonder,
Mrs. Haddon, you climb on out the best you can.”</p>

<p>She did so quickly and lightly. Haddon clumsily
scrambled out on his knees, red of face, still grumbling,
irritable.</p>

<p>They stood now on a flat ledge of the sandstone
which made a fair footway, broken here and there
with steps as one eroded stratum after another dropped
down. The river itself had cut through the entire
ledge in the course of ages, and made a plunge, as
has been stated, of many feet. From their new place
of vantage they could see the full height of what the
mountaineers called the “king breaker” of the Narrows&mdash;a
white crest of up-flung water which rolled
back toward the foot of the cascade before it was
caught in the downward pull of the current. The
roar of the water was now full in their ears. The
spot was gloomy, oppressive.</p>

<p>“I wish it wasn’t so dark!” said Marcia Haddon,
huddling her arms to her. She scarce had spoken for
an hour before. “It’s growing colder, too.”</p>

<p>“We’ll not be long, Ma’am,” said Joslin. “Don’t
be afraid at all. Just walk on up, and I’ll get the boat
up a little way.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” said Haddon. “It’s late, but I
just want to try to make a picture here&mdash;I want to
show the boys what sort of a place this is that they’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
sent me to&mdash;I’ve left my camera on the boat seat.
I’ll have a try at it anyhow.”</p>

<p>As Joslin now paused, bracing back on the painter
of the heavy skiff, it was caught by a strong side current
where the stream was flung back from its impact
against the rocky bank&mdash;a current which ran out,
headed almost midstream, toward the main break of
the big wave. The boat, held thus strongly, had no
great bearing on the water at its bow, but Haddon,
unaccustomed to such matters, forgot that, or did not
know it. Before Joslin could stop him he was clumsily
bending over as though to climb once more into
the boat, tugging at the gunwale to pull it closer to
him.</p>

<p>It was then, in some way&mdash;no one could tell how&mdash;that
his foot stumbled and caught at a ledge of the
rock. He pitched forward into the unstable portion
of the boat, stumbled, and, as the wash of the water
came in-board, went over, still under the impetus of
his fall, and sank, directly into the outflung current.
It all had happened in an instant, nor could mortal
man have prevented it.</p>

<p>Marcia Haddon for just half a moment saw the
upturned face of her husband as it disappeared, a
face on which horror was written&mdash;unspeakable and
unforgettable horror. The next instant he was gone&mdash;he
was under.</p>

<p>“Quick!” called Joslin sharply to Marcia Haddon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
and cast her the rope. “Make it fast over something.”</p>

<p>But he did not stop to see whether or not her weak
strength would serve to hold the boat. He was kicking
off his shoes, throwing off his coat, even as he
spoke, his eyes fixed on the water, as he made ready
for a leap few men would have dared.</p>

<p>A hat floated, far below. But nothing else showed&mdash;neither
here in the eddy, nor yonder in the side current,
nor in the great pool below. Haddon had gone
deep in his fall, he might have been carried out somewhere
midstream, but why did he not show on the
surface somewhere in all this time?</p>

<p>All the time he called back over his shoulder reassuringly
to Marcia Haddon, but he could not see what
she was doing&mdash;only he waited, eyes outward, straining,
to find some object on the waters&mdash;some object
now so fatally long delayed. But nothing showed.
At length, hesitating no longer, he did what no man
ever had been known to do before. He dived straight
out for the foot of the up-flung crest of the Narrows
of the Kentucky&mdash;straight down under the roll of the
“king breaker” itself.</p>

<p>Joslin before now had seen a log roll about here
for hours in the clutch of the back-turned wave, tossing
up and down until at length some freak of the
current set it free. He fancied that perhaps Haddon
might be caught in something of the same way. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
was one chance in ten thousand for him now, one in
hundreds for the man who was giving him that
chance. Would he win?</p>

<p>A myriad of blue-white bubbles made a veil across
the current down in below, and he saw this vaguely,
although the sun was so low that the water was lighted
but ill at this hour. The yeast of the water did not
hold him up well&mdash;he sunk deeper, still deeper, he
knew not how far down. Blindly his arms reached
out, feeling every way. They touched nothing&mdash;the
thin, oxygenated fluid hardly could be felt at all. He
rose, swam on across the stream, on, out, indeed, he
knew not where. He rose just beyond the foot of
the main chute, having been down longer than he
dreamed a man might stay and live.</p>

<p>But when he found himself still able to swim and
still able to see, when he had flung the water from his
eyes, he still saw nothing near him, nothing on the
black pool. He was alone. He could hear the cries
of a woman. He could not go back. It was all he
could do to reach the further shore.</p>

<p>He landed well toward the foot of the pool, with
difficulty pulling himself out upon the ledge there.
But as he turned once more, nothing but the black and
the white water met his gaze. James Haddon was
gone. Where?</p>

<p>He dared not now look across to the woman whom
he saw wringing her hands. He ran to the head of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the pool, toward the flat rock where lay some charred
embers of many earlier fires. Eagerly, intently, he
looked out and down upon the water for some sign
of what he sought.</p>

<p>There was some sort of sign! Deep below the surface,
it seemed to him he saw some long dark object,
floating, swinging, rising and falling, but not going
down on the current. It hung as though held. Was
it some log? Joslin knew it could not be.</p>

<p>Drawing his breath in deep and full, he sprang again
far out, feeling with his arms, with his feet, but at
first touching nothing. Suddenly, just inside the
ridge of white water, there came up against his body
from below a heavy blow, as from some object flung
upward by a giant hand.</p>

<p>It was the body of James Haddon, swaying there.
It was swaying strangely, for some unknown reason.
It was James Haddon’s free hand had smitten Joslin
in the face as though contemptuous of him even now.</p>

<p>But Joslin caught at the hand, tugged at it. The
body would not give&mdash;it swayed in the current, but
it still was held!</p>

<p>Joslin knew now what it meant. Slowly, gasping,
he turned once more to his side of the river, and once
more climbed out upon the ledge. He was growing
weaker, but there was yet much to be done. He
dared not look across the river now. In truth, Marcia
Haddon’s face most of the time was buried in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
hands&mdash;only she raised it once in a while to see what
new terror was here for her.</p>

<p>She saw this strange man, apparently insane, on
the farther side of the river, once more pull himself
up on the ledge, once more run up to the head of the
pool, once more stand there, at the edge, hesitating.</p>

<p>But Joslin was hesitating only to summon up his
powers once more. When he dived this time, the
open blade of his pocket knife was in his teeth. He
swam out again, and she saw him working part of
the time above, part of the time below the water, the
dark outline of his own body now and again flung out,
visible above the course of the white water which
ridged down into the dark pool.</p>

<p>At last she saw his head turn. He followed something,
apparently, down through the fast water, down
into the black, down to the foot of the pool. She
guessed what it must be.</p>

<p>Joslin had known what held the body of James
Haddon fast. Carried deep down outward by the side
current, Haddon had felt something floating down
there, had caught at it&mdash;a thing no larger than the
straw at which a drowning man will clutch. It was
no larger than a straw&mdash;the thick cord of a fisherman’s
heavy set-line, armed with hooks depending on
short lines&mdash;two score hooks or more, each of them a
man-trap in such waters. As he had grasped at this
line the current had carried him on down. The first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
hook had impaled him, passing entirely through the
palm of his hand. He swung without any possibility
of escape. Below him somewhere two or more heavy
catfish were tugging at the line, themselves impaled
without hope of escape.</p>

<p>All these things had caused what Joslin had seen&mdash;the
strange swaying of the man’s body back and
forth there below the surface.</p>

<p>And Joslin knew by the time the body had reached
the foot of the pool, by the time he had cut loose the
remaining line and dragged the body up on the beach
below, that all hope was long since gone for James
Haddon.</p>

<p>Weakly now and inefficiently he did what he could
to try to revive life in the victim, but the bluish-purple
face, the wide-open mouth, the staring eyes, told him
well enough the truth.</p>

<p>Joslin rose after a time. The woman was standing
there still, her hands at the side of her face, staring.
He knew that she must know.</p>

<p>The boat was gone. Joslin looked down the stream.
He saw it on his side of the river, by freak of the
stream grounded on the bar which made out from
the point. He hastened to the boat, waded out, caught
it, and with the oars by chance left in the boat made
his way upstream to the foot of the pool. With difficulty
he got into the bottom of the boat the heavy
body of the dead man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not speak at all when at length the boat lay
once more along shore on the left-hand bank, below
the flat ledge on which Marcia Haddon stood. He
caught the painter now around the stump of a
gnarled cedar near the edge, and so turned toward
her at last, facing the hardest of all this grievous
task.</p>

<p>She stepped slowly, horror-smitten, toward the
brink, her hands at her temples. Joslin held her
by the arm as she looked down into the swaying
boat. The face of her husband stared up at
her&mdash;bluish-white, the thickened lips open, the eyes
staring.</p>

<p>“You must go away,” said Joslin at last.&mdash;“Go over
there in the brush and sit down. I’ll have to drop the
boat down.”</p>

<p>He did drop it down to a point where the ledge
dipped so that he could make some sort of landing.
Slowly, with very much difficulty, he managed to disembark
the ghastly cargo. Able to do no more, he
literally dragged the body of James Haddon out and
let it lie upon the sand at the edge of a thicket. But
she had followed him and looked down speechless as
she knelt now, her hands still at her face, her head
shaking from side to side.</p>

<p>“Jim! Jim!” she whispered. “Oh! Oh!”</p>

<p>“I feel as though it had been my fault,” broke out
Joslin. “I put out that set-line myself when I came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
through yesterday. We fish there for catfish all the
time&mdash;they run in that deep water out there. He
must have got fouled in the line somewhere when he
got in. My God!&mdash;I feel as though I had killed him
myself.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="pch">THE COMING OF JAMES HADDON</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE sun was gone, and the shadows were
black in the defile. The ancient river went
on with its mocking of them, now low and
hoarse, now cynically shrieking, as the voice of flowing
water will come, altered by the currents of the air.</p>

<p>The two thus alone in the wilderness spoke not at
all for some time, and then Joslin could only go on in
his own self-reproach.</p>

<p>“It was where we built the fires, Ma’am,” he said
vaguely, still endeavoring to explain what could not
be explained save in the books of the gods. “I’ve sat
there myself more than one night&mdash;I studied there,
Ma’am, read my lessons, getting ready to teach. I
read while I waited for the fish to bite. I set that
line my own self. I never knew&mdash;oh! it seems as
though I had done this with my own hand.”</p>

<p>“Don’t,” she said, gentle and just even now. “I was
afraid you both were gone. Please don’t talk. I’m
afraid&mdash;oh, I’m afraid!&mdash;and I’m so cold&mdash;I’m so
very cold.”</p>

<p>She was shivering now, Joslin as well. He hurried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
to his flung coat and found matches this time,
came with bits of drift wood, pieces of dry brandies.
He built a little fire. “You must get warm,” said he.</p>

<p>“What shall we do? Oh, what shall we do? This
awful place&mdash;oh, this awful place!”</p>

<p>“Wait just a little,” said David Joslin. “You must
get warm.”</p>

<p>They cowered at the fire, two small human objects
here in the grip of the wilderness, in the hands of
fate indeed. It was some time before Joslin raised his
head.</p>

<p>“There’s someone coming&mdash;I hear a wagon on the
rocks, Ma’am,” said he, starting up. “You stay here&mdash;I’ll
go see&mdash;it must be someone on the trail above.”</p>

<p>He hurried to the edge of the undergrowth and
disappeared. The sound of wheels became apparent
to her ears. Soon after they stopped she saw Joslin
come again, accompanied by a tall gaunt man his equal
in stature, a man who came and stood near by her,
looking down in pity.</p>

<p>“Ma’am,” said he, “this is mighty bad&mdash;mighty
bad.”</p>

<p>“Help me, Absalom,” said David Joslin. “Mrs.
Haddon, you go over there. We’re going to take him
to the wagon.”</p>

<p>Marcia Haddon turned away, her face buried in her
hands. She did not see David Joslin and Absalom
Gannt as they bent and lifted between them the dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
body of the man who but now might have boasted
that he held these and the land of these in the hollow
of his hand. They held him now, neck and heels,
in the hollows of their hands, such being the will of
fate. They carried him up the hillside, and they laid
him on the top of the rough load of lumber which
was to make his resting place for a time. Then they
came back after the woman.</p>

<p>“I was down to the mill fer a load,” said Absalom
to Joslin as they walked. “Hit’s a lucky thing. That’s
his wife? Oh, my Lordy, hain’t that hard! Ye say
he’s the Company man? He was rich&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Very rich,” said Joslin. “She’s a good woman,
his wife. We’ll have to help her, Absalom. She’ll
have to stay with us for a while. We’ll have to bury
him in here, I reckon&mdash;he couldn’t ever be got out.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, how come him to get in thar, anyways?”</p>

<p>“Fell into the boat&mdash;and on over&mdash;he was trying
to get something out of the boat,” replied Joslin.
“The current carried him down under. You saw his
hand&mdash;that was where I cut the fish hook out. He was
swinging on the set-line when I saw him. I was on
the other side then.”</p>

<p>“Ye’ve had a hard time savin’ of him, Davy, that’s
shore enough,” rejoined Absalom soberly. “I know
what that water is. Well, the Narrers has got one
more man. Damn ‘em, anyways!”</p>

<p>They spoke no more when they had come to Marcia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Haddon. She felt the hand of each of these tall men,
one at each elbow, aiding her to rise, aiding her up
the steep slope of the mountain, aiding her to climb
up on the load of lumber where lay the long shrouded
figure, covered with coats now&mdash;all that was left of
what had been, or ought to have been, all in the world
to her.</p>

<p>Absalom Gannt took up the reins and sat at the
front of the load of lumber, his back toward them.
Joslin sat at one side of the load, reaching out a hand
now and then to steady Marcia Haddon, who sat opposite,
swaying weakly against the rude jolting of the
vehicle on the rough mountain roads. His hand was
light, gentle, quickly withdrawn. The wagon wheels,
creaking and groaning, sent their protest now up
against the mountain side as they jolted onward.
The wagon, tilting and rocking, carried on. Now and
again the long shrouded object rolled horribly from
one side to the other. On one side it met a hand firm
and strong&mdash;this sodden body of James Haddon, now
gone to his accounting. Upon the other side it met a
hand which steadied it gently&mdash;the hand of a woman
who, all her unhappy life, had never been otherwise
than gentle with him.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE FURRIN WOMAN</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE new doctor from the new town on the
new railroad came not only once, but many
times to call upon Marcia Haddon, seriously
ill at Granny Williams’ home. A high fever held her
by the time she had arrived in the night after that
terrible day upon the river. By the next day delirium
had its will of her. The kindly inhabitants called
it “chills and fever.” It was a chilled heart, a fevered
mind.</p>

<p>Granny Williams was wholly contemptuous of the
new doctor, or of any doctor. It was Joslin who
insisted that the old-woman remedies should not be
trusted, who sent for the only modern physician thus
far known in that portion of the world. The presence
of the latter was accepted only grudgingly by Granny
Williams, who insisted that camomile and boneset was
all the “furrin woman” needed. But the new doctor,
himself a voice in the wilderness, was a young man
who understood many things.</p>

<p>When after many days his patient had worn out
the fever and showed certain signs of convalescence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
she lay a long time with mind apparently a blank,
inquiring nothing as to her surroundings, and equally
incurious in regard to herself.</p>

<p>“Where is he?” she asked at length, upon one day
when Joslin had come to find how she was progressing.
She had come, weakly, to look forward to these
daily visits, although often she did not speak to him
at all.</p>

<p>“We cared for him,” answered he. “When you are
well enough we’ll show you. We sent out a man with
a telegram. We have word for you.”</p>

<p>She shook her head slowly from side to side.
“Poor boy,” she said, “poor boy! Well, it’s over for
him. I wish it were for me.” For the time she did
not speak further.</p>

<p>But slowly, under inexorable nature’s rule, the duty
of living came forward to her consciousness, insistent,
imperative. Marcia Haddon, little by little, undertook
once more to knit the raveled sleeve. The
strangeness of her new surroundings proved of itself
a benefit. The faces that she saw about her, kindly
as they were, were faces as of another world. Those
who attended her spoke a language which at first she
scarcely understood. For days she lay and looked at
them with not even a smile upon her face to thank
them, passive, incurious, but after a time observing and
questioning.</p>

<p>“She’s powerful weak,” said old Granny Williams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
to a neighbor, shaking her head now and then. “Them
furrin women kain’t stand nothin’. To look at her
ye’d think she was the one that got drownded in the
Narrers, not him.</p>

<p>“They say he was moughty rich,” she continued.
“They say he owned all the land acrosst the river from
here, an’ him an’ his Company owns half of Hell-fer-Sartin,
an’ most on Newfound. Well, I reckon it
won’t do him no sight of good right now&mdash;nor her
neither, onlessen she gets pearter right soon. If she
hain’t better in a week or so, we’d e’en about as well
measure her.”</p>

<p>But they did not measure Marcia Haddon for her
grave clothes. She began again to take up the affairs
of life. She found the sympathy of all these people
of a very gentle sort. The secretiveness and the
apathy of the Cumberlands, taking life as it came, were
extended to the stranger as well. But all her life it
had been Marcia Haddon’s trait to observe rather than
to talk; and for a long time she only observed&mdash;and
pondered what she saw.</p>

<p>These strange people&mdash;how poor they were, How
very poor! Their furniture was mostly made by hand&mdash;these
chairs, their legs stubbed by an age of wear
on the puncheon floors, went back a generation or
more. She rested in a corded bed, made of walnut
in rude mountain workmanship. The table upon which
she saw daily meals served was hewn out by a local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
carpenter. The spinning wheel whose whirring she
heard in another room was, as Granny Williams assured
her, made by her own father in an earlier time.
“An’ she’s a good wheel,” added the old woman. “I
kin run her all day an’ she’ll never onct throw her
band.” The little flax wheel with its more strident
hum also was an heirloom carefully preserved.</p>

<p>And all these people were so busy, so under the
constant necessity of individual, personal labor. The
skeining and the hanking of yarns, the winding of
bobbins for the looms, the repair of the loom sleighs by
the ancient who made a specialty in such matters&mdash;all
these things spoke of a day entirely foreign to all
the experience of Marcia Haddon, who, born into easy
circumstances, in another country, never had known
real labor.</p>

<p>There was no cook-stove in Granny Williams’ house&mdash;the
old pot-hooks at the fireside, the crane and its
pendent hooks, the heavy cast-iron oven, the brass
kettles, an infrequent copper vessel of this sort or that&mdash;all
these went back to another day. The “furrin
woman” for the first time in her life saw what was
the responsibility of a home, saw first the beauty of
personal industry.</p>

<p>Time was coming on now for the hoeing of the
corn planted on these steep hillsides. From her window
Marcia Haddon could see women working along
with the men, children as well. And then Granny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Williams would tell her of her own young wifehood,
when with her husband she had started in to clear their
farm, and had helped in digging out the stumps and
in logging up the felled trees for the burning. She
spoke with pride of granddaughters of her own able
to do as good a day at the hoe as “ary man.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a hundred and twenty-two children an’
grandchildren,” said Granny Williams with much
pride, “or else it’s two hundred and twenty-six&mdash;I
don’t remember which. I could have tolt it all right
a while back, but someone made off with my fam’ly
stick&mdash;I had it all notched on a stick. Ever’ time a
grandbaby was borned I cut a notch on that stick, an’
I lef’ it out at the woodshed. I reckon somebody
taken it fer a poker. How many children have ye got,
Ma’am?”</p>

<p>“None,” said Marcia Haddon.</p>

<p>Granny Williams looked at her with pity, but made
no comment, for this thing, to her so deplorable and
indeed so disgraceful, was not to be mentioned in
reproach.</p>

<p>Humoring the sick woman, she contented herself
with showing the many articles about the house which
she herself had made with her own hands&mdash;counterpanes
and quilts, cloth woven on her own hand-loom.
There were a few things which she declared must
have come “acrosst the mountings”; that is to say, they
must have been brought in by her ancestors in the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
migration over the Appalachians. A book or two&mdash;strangely
enough, an old Latin grammar&mdash;remained of
these belongings.</p>

<p>“I kain’t read in none of ‘em,” admitted Granny
Williams. “Some of my folks mought have been able
to onct, but none of us kin read or write.</p>

<p>“Do ye reckon, Ma’am,” she added, “that when the
railroad comes we’ll be able to buy calico an’ jeans
in the stores? Hit’s powerful slow weavin’ cloth,
though I will say it wears longer’n anything what ye
kin buy.... How old was ye when ye first begun to
spin, Ma’am?”</p>

<p>“I never did,” said Marcia Haddon. “I can’t even
knit.”</p>

<p>“Well, ‘pears like ye must be powerful triflin’,”
said Granny Williams candidly, plying her own needles
with renewed zeal at the moment.</p>

<p>Marcia Haddon looked at her suddenly. “I believe
you’re right, Granny!” said she.</p>

<p>“That new railroad,” resumed the old lady, presently,
“hit’s a-goin’ to change a power of things in
these valleys. I always said that if it actual come in
here, I was a-goin’ to take one ride on it if it kilt me.
Plenty of our folks is a-skeered to go on the railroad
keers. Now, thar was Preacher Bonnell&mdash;he went
Outside, an’ he taken a ride on them railroad keers,
an’ it liken to been the eend on him. He tolt us all
about it when he come back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“Preacher Bonnell was a-ridin’ along in the keers
with his haid outen the winder, an’ he seen a place
bigger’n a house, a regular black hole in the side of
the hill, an’ the engyne an’ all them keers a-headin’
right straight fer it. He knowed in a minute the
Devil had a holt of the engyne, an’ that this here was
the Bottomless Pit whar he was a-goin’ to take all
them people. Preacher Bonnell, he up an’ give one
whoop, an’ off he jumped. He rolled down on the
bank more’n fifty feet, an’ when he come to be looked
up, an’ thar wasn’t nary sign of the engyne or them
keers! They had went right inter the Pit, like he had
knowed they would. Preacher Bonnell, he said it war
a leadin’ to him nuvver to go on no more railroad
keers. He says something about that every sermon
he preaches nowadays. He warns us all agin them
keers. I don’t see how ye ever had the heart, Ma’am,
to ride on them things, weak an’ triflin’ as ye seem
mostly. Fact is, what made ye come in here anyways,
Ma’am?”</p>

<p>“It was my husband&mdash;you know he was one of the
officers of the Company that owns so much land
around here. I had met Mr. Joslin before. He went
to New York with us two years ago.”</p>

<p>“Well, ye’ll see a moughty big building up on
yon hill, Ma’am,” said Granny Williams with pride.
“Davy, he’s a-buildin’ it. Hit sartin is bigger’n arything
ye ever seen in New York. Hit’s bigger’n ary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
church house ever was knowed in these mountings. I
reckon it was part of the boarding they had in that
load of lumber they brung yore man in on.</p>

<p>“But Davy,” she went on, “he’s changed a heap,
these last two years. Used to be as natteral fer him
to swear as to take a drink&mdash;an’ in buildin’ a house
swearin’ comes natteral to ary man. But thar hain’t
nary man heerd Davy Joslin say one cuss word sence
he come back from the North. All the trouble he’s
had with his wife, too&mdash;&mdash; Ye know about his wife?”</p>

<p>“I knew he was married.”</p>

<p>“He was, an’ he hain’t,” said Granny Williams.
“Well, Meliss’, she tuk an’ up an’ went over to the
railroad an’ seen the new lawyer that’s come in thar,
an’ last term of co’te she got her a divorce&mdash;that’s
what she done. That was a few weeks ago, while ye
was sick.”</p>

<p>“Divorce? He didn’t tell me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That must of been a right inter<i>est</i>in’ term of co’te,
Ma’am. Thar was only two men kilt, an’ this here
one <i>di</i>vorce&mdash;but it’s the fust <i>di</i>vorce ever knowed in
this country. They say he didn’t make no furse at
all about her leavin’ of him. Somebody was a-tellin’
me that that leaves her free to marry agin if she wants
to, or him either. Nuvver was such a thing knowed in
these mountings afore, fur as I can tell&mdash;there shorely
wasn’t nuvver such a thing knowed among my people,
nor my dad’s people, nor my mammy’s neither.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course, they didn’t have no children&mdash;er only
leastways two puny ones, that died. An’ ye said ye
never had no children at all, Ma’am?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Marcia Haddon, her face flushed.</p>

<p>“Well, ye look to me right triflin’,” said Granny
Williams with calm candor. “Ye kain’t knit, ye kain’t
spin, an’ I reckon ye couldn’t hoe corn noways. Maybe
the Lord knows His business&mdash;what could a womern
like ye do with children if she had ‘em?</p>

<p>“I was merried when I was sixteen year an’ eight
month old,” she ran on. “I had eighteen children
that lived, an’ three that died. Like I said, I could of
tolt ye how many grandchildren I had in all, ef someone
hadn’t been so keerless with that air countin’ stick
of mine.</p>

<p>“Air ye goin’ to merry agin arter a while maybe?”
she added. “Some does.” She spoke in a wholly
matter-of-fact way.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t talk to me about such things,
Granny,” said Marcia Haddon, a faint flush still on
her cheek.</p>

<p>“How comes I mustn’t?” rejoined Granny. “Hain’t
yore man dead?”</p>

<p>“I know you mean it well”&mdash;Marcia Haddon reached
out a hand to the gnarled hand of the old woman who
sat close by. “All my life&mdash;it’s been so different,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Davy tolt us something about them things,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the old woman gravely. “I’m content to live right
here the way we always done&mdash;leastways, I will be if
I ever git to take jest one ride on them railroad keers.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they’ll come through here before long,” said
Marcia Haddon. “I’m not sure I’m glad&mdash;usually
when a railroad comes into a new country it changes
it so much.”</p>

<p>“Hit’s had changes a-plenty already, seems to me,”
said Granny. “Thar hain’t been a killin’ in here fer
two year; sence the big meetin’ down at the mill house
nobody’s been ridin’ fer nobody else, an’ nobody layin’
out&mdash;the old fam’ly diffikilties seemed to jest come to
stop right suddent. An’ as fer liquor&mdash;why, of course
ye know here, Ma’am, everybody makes his own liquor,
as much as he wants. An’ now ye kain’t hardly git a
bottle of liquor in lessen four er five hours, an’ I
declar’, ye have to look around a heap to find that!
How come that? Well, it was Davy Joslin done that&mdash;him
an’ his school. Like ye, I dunno if I’m glad
er not.”</p>

<p>“He’s a good man,” said her listener vaguely.</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ odd as Adam’s off ox. Kain’t nobody
explain Davy noways. While ago, couple of year
back, he was called to be a preacher. Then he goes
Outside fer a couple of year, an’ comes back, an’&mdash;ye
never seen sech a change in no human man in all
yer borned life, Ma’am&mdash;his clothes is different, he
walks different, an’ he talks different. Kain’t hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
nobody understand him no more. But he hain’t done
preached onct! But everybody knows that if Davy
says he’s a-goin’ to run that school, it’ll <i>run</i>, some
time.</p>

<p>“Ye see,” she went on, “accordin’ to Davy’s count,
it’s the Lord that does things.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s right,” said Marcia Haddon slowly.
“Which one of us shall say?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Granny Williams after a while, thrusting
her needles through her ball of yarn, “Ef I was
ye, I wouldn’t bother much about nothin’ fer a time
yit. Ye got plenty of money anyways&mdash;yore man was
plumb rich, accordin’ to all I hear. Like enough he
done lef ye a thousand dollar, Ma’am? Davy’s tolt
me about how ye an’ him lived. But ontel ye git ready
to go home, Ma’am, ye’re welcome here, jest as welcome
as the flowers, an’ as long as ye like.</p>

<p>“When ye kin begin to walk around a bit,” she
concluded, “we’ll take ye an’ show ye whar we buried
yore man. Hit’s up in the old buryin’ ground on the
hill&mdash;my folks is buried thar, an’ my daddy’s folks,
years an’ years back, an’ plenty of others&mdash;fifty or
maybe a hundred year, fer’s I kin tell. Hit’s right
qu’ite an’ purty up thar.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="pch">WHEN GHOSTS ARISE</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">MARCIA HADDON’S lawyers wrote with
greater and greater insistence from New
York, asking her return to care for the
matters of the estate of James Haddon, but she still
shrank from the thought of going back to the old
associations. A strange apathy encompassed her, a
leaden indifference to life, as though all were ended
for her as well as for the unfortunate lying yonder
on the hill. She found nothing in life to interest her,
to offer her any hope, to excite in her any ambition.
“I’m useless, useless!” said she to herself more than
once. She held her own life in review now, day after
day, feeling herself unworthy and forsaken, herself too
merciless a critic of herself.</p>

<p>Joslin she saw frequently. His visits were quiet,
unobtrusive, almost apologetic. He was very sad, and
always taciturn, but she often looked forward to his
coming with something to ask him, something to
discuss.</p>

<p>“I feel so worthless here!” she broke out, suddenly,
to him one evening, as she sat in her chair, looking out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
across the blue hills of the valley below them. “It’s
time for me to be going home, I suppose&mdash;&mdash; But I
don’t think there ever was a woman so worthless in
all the world, nor one so much alone. I don’t want
to go back. Granny Williams&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He sat silent, looking across the forests as they lay
in the twilight.</p>

<p>“Some day,” he said slowly, after a time, “will
you ride out with me, Mrs. Haddon, into these hills,
with one of our women here? I’ll show you things,
Ma’am, you never thought could exist in all the world.</p>

<p>“Do you know what I’ve been doing, Ma’am?” he
went on. “I mean since I came back here? At night,
when I have time, I’m teaching school&mdash;I’ve begun
already.”</p>

<p>He smiled at her with his wide, pleasant smile.
“My first scholar, Ma’am, is old Absalom Gannt. He’s
the man that killed my father&mdash;or made him kill
himself. He’s the leader of the Gannt faction.
There’s been war between the Gannts and Joslins long
as anybody can remember in these mountains. Well,
Absalom was my first scholar!”</p>

<p>She only looked at him quietly. “What made him
come?” said she at length.</p>

<p>“You measure your own ignorance of these people
by that question,” said he. “I’ve got a night class of
twenty people, every one of them over forty-five&mdash;men
and women both&mdash;some women with babies in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
their arms. They don’t know how to read or write.
They’re learning their letters, Ma’am&mdash;like little
children! What’s the difference whether we’re happy
or not? It’s no consequence if we’ve got something
to do. Don’t you think there’s much to be done, here?”</p>

<p>“Children?” said Marcia Haddon vaguely&mdash;“Old
Granny Williams said&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I had two children. I was glad they died. But
I’m trying to make ways for other children to grow
up fit to live.”</p>

<p>She sat for a long time, her hands idly in her
lap, her pale face turned steadily out toward the enigma
of these hills.</p>

<p>“Spartan!” she exclaimed. “All Spartans! And I
had so much! They tell me my husband’s estate will
be about two million dollars.”</p>

<p>David Joslin smiled. “It must be fine,” said he,
“to know where your next meal’s going to come from.
I’ve hardly ever known that.”</p>

<p>“Granny Williams said&mdash;&mdash; You see, I have no
children of my own. And here&mdash;why, here are hundreds
waiting.”</p>

<p>He was looking far over the hills.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose,” she went on after a time; as he
remained silent, “do you suppose if I built another
building up on the hill, with a part of this money he
made out of this very country&mdash;if I built one building
for girls, dormitories, you know, or class rooms&mdash;big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
enough for two or three hundred children&mdash;would
there be that many?”</p>

<p>He smiled. “Many thousands,” he replied. “They’d
come from fifty miles around, a hundred miles&mdash;everyone
begging, like these old people in my night classes,
to learn how to read and write. They want <i>knowledge</i>,
Ma’am! They want up&mdash;they want <i>out</i>! If you could
help in that&mdash;I don’t think you’d feel ‘worthless,’ ever
again! Whether you ever did that or not, you
mustn’t ever say that word again. At least, you’ve
given one man, once hopeless, his hope and his chance&mdash;and
his dreams, we’ll say. I’ve had quite some
dreams, you see.”</p>

<p>“Fifteen or twenty thousand dollars would go quite
a way toward making a building of that sort?”</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>“There’s not been fifty dollars put into our building,
I suppose, Ma’am,” said he. “Twenty thousand
dollars&mdash;that’s more money than there is in all this
county. But there’s twenty thousand millions in
sight of where we sit.”</p>

<p>She turned to him contritely&mdash;“It’s plain enough
what my husband and his Company wanted to do with
these people&mdash;they wanted to steal away their very
birthright, before they were wise enough to know its
value. It wouldn’t be charity for me&mdash;it wouldn’t
be even a gift. It wouldn’t be a fraction of what you
have owing to you from me and mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>“And it might be done too,” she went on shrewdly.
“With the Johnston and Bulkley and Oddingham
holdings, my husband’s estate would pretty nearly
control the Land Company’s affairs&mdash;they would vote
with me, I’m sure. So maybe, you see”&mdash;smiling for
almost the first time in all these weeks&mdash;“it was in my
destiny to come here?”</p>

<p>“It may have been,” said David Joslin simply.</p>

<p>She ran on eagerly now. “We’ll have a church
up there too, some time. Couldn’t you be the preacher
some time, Mr. Joslin? And of course you’ll be president
of the college. Listen at me talking! I’m just
like a child.</p>

<p>“But you don’t answer,” she said, looking at him
keenly. He was staring out steadily. Gaunt, with
sunken eyes and prominent cheekbones, worn and
drawn by the long hours of labor bodily and mental,
David Joslin was not a handsome man, nor did even
physical well-being seem vouchsafed to him now. He
was sad, very sad. It seemed to her she had never seen
a face so sad as his.</p>

<p>“Of course,” she reiterated, “you’ll be the president.
You’ll have to preach&mdash;no one else could.”</p>

<p>He turned to her and half raised a hand. “You
mustn’t,” said he. “That’s my school&mdash;yes. But I
can’t be its president.”</p>

<p>“Why? What do you mean, Mr. Joslin?”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand. No, I reckon not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“No.” She shook her head. “You start a thing
and don’t finish it&mdash;is that the plan? And this the very
thing in all your life which outweighed everything
else? And you’ve got me to thinking it was a wonderful
thing that you had planned. You’d drop it
now?”</p>

<p>She was resting her chin on her hands, now white
and thin, supported on Granny Williams’ cane. Now
she lifted her head and half turned away. He caught
the significance of the act, and it made his gaunt face
paler.</p>

<p>“Well,” replied he quietly, “now perhaps you can
see why I’m not happy.”</p>

<p>She looked at him so deeply regretful that he pulled
together with a resolve obviously painful.</p>

<p>“You don’t know much about me. That’s of no
importance. But if you are interested in my school
and my people, then I do become important in one
way. Shall I have to tell you about myself?”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said she, nodding. “Yes.”</p>

<p>So then, simply, baldly, unsparing of himself, he
did go on and tell her about himself and his life&mdash;the
hopelessness of it, the narrowness, the meagerness, the
despair of it all, the tenfold shackles of misery and
ignorance which had held him and all his so long.
Then he told her of his own marriage; and of the end
of it.</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder you are unhappy,” said she slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
at last. “But still I don’t know why you should not
go on with your school as you planned.”</p>

<p>“I reckon I’ll have to tell you all the rest,” said
David Joslin desperately after a time. “I didn’t think
I ever could.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” she asked simply.</p>

<p>“You want to know what is my stumbling block?
I’ll tell you&mdash;it was a woman.”</p>

<p>“You mean your wife? But I don’t think I ought
to discuss that.” She half rose.</p>

<p>But she could not stop him now as he went on
stumblingly, unalterably.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Not that woman&mdash;my wife,” said he.
“Another.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t tell me anything more, I think,” said
she. “Are you going to tell me just some common
story about yourself and some woman?”</p>

<p>“That’s just precisely what I’m going to do!” said
he. “I’m going to kill all the respect for me you’ve
ever had. Then you’ll know why I can’t be president
of my own college. I’ll have to go through fire before
I can. I’m not good enough. Now then you can see.”</p>

<p>“Who was she? When&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“You ought to know, certainly. It was your husband&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She sat up suddenly, her eyes flashing. “<i>That</i>
woman&mdash;&mdash;!”</p>

<p>“So then you knew her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why should I not?” rejoined Marcia Haddon, now
all aflame. “Did she not ruin my married life, as
much of it as there was to ruin? Didn’t all the town
know about her, and him&mdash;and me? Of all the women
in the world I ought to hate, that’s the one!”</p>

<p>“And of all the men in the world you will hate,
I’m the one,” said David Joslin. “But I can’t lie to
you now. My conscience made me a coward for a
while, but it’s my way to go on through.”</p>

<p>“How could you have known that woman? When
did you meet?”</p>

<p>“Twice,” said David Joslin. “Once was at the dinner
of the Company; the next in the morning at her
own rooms. That was twice, in New York.”</p>

<p>She looked at him, utter scorn upon her face. Her
cheeks at last had color.</p>

<p>“Don’t be too harsh if you can help it,” he began
once more, half raising his hand. “Don’t suspect too
much in some ways. In others you can’t suspect
enough. You don’t understand&mdash;&mdash; Well, I was a
fool. I was tempted. The Evil One followed me right
along all the time from the day I left these mountains.
He was right at my side every minute, though I didn’t
know it. I reckon it was <i>you</i> that kept him away
from me, Ma’am. For me, you have been the power
of light. If I had stayed right close to you I’d never
had such temptation. The Evil One had his own
devices with me&mdash;it was&mdash;it was the temptation of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Anthony, Ma’am. I can’t well talk. Can you understand?”</p>

<p>“It’s not necessary for me to understand!” said
Marcia Haddon in white scorn. “I understand enough
already. That woman was my husband’s mistress&mdash;everyone
knew it except you&mdash;or did you know it?”</p>

<p>He turned upon her a face now suddenly so horrified
in its suffering that even she relented.</p>

<p>“I’ve&mdash;I’ve been very ignorant, Ma’am,” said he.
“I’ve known very little. I&mdash;didn’t know that. I
thought she was very beautiful and good. Oh, not
so beautiful as you, not so good&mdash;but what could I
know about such things? I’ve never met but three
women in my life, you might say. Well, you know
the three, and you’re one of the three. You see, I
didn’t know much about women, that’s all. Well,
what she told me was true.”</p>

<p>“But surely you must have known&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How could I know? How much experience had
I? How far had my education gone? I’ve met three
women in all my life, I said. I’ve had two years of
school. Well, that’s all. That’s my life. It isn’t
much. I never knew much of&mdash;what you say.”</p>

<p>“Often?” asked Marcia Haddon&mdash;“How could it
have been often that you met her?”</p>

<p>“Twice, Ma’am,” said David Joslin. “The last
time to say good-by. That was up at Strattonville,
not so very long ago. If it hadn’t been for that, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
reckon I’d have gone on and finished my college course.
I reckon maybe if I hadn’t met her then I could have
been a preacher some time&mdash;I could have been president
of this school&mdash;I could have had my life’s ambition
and my hope. You say she ruined your life.
Didn’t it come to the same thing with me? But I
can’t call her bad&mdash;surely it wasn’t her fault in the
least. I reckon it was the fault of life. But that was
why I came back so soon. And that was why I met
you when you came in. And you&mdash;you are a woman
too.... But of another sort, I suppose. Better&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Did you know,” she said to him after a time, “that
the Polly Pendleton Company was backed by my husband’s
money all along? He was out on the road for
weeks at a time&mdash;he practically abandoned me. Well,
that was my husband!”</p>

<p>“And I’ve lost every honest dream of all my life
because of that same woman,” he spoke after a time.
“She herself tried to tell me, and I wouldn’t believe
her. Well, you’ve made it easier.</p>

<p>“Not that it wasn’t over anyhow,” he added, with
not the slightest trace of self-pride in his words.
“Ma’am, let me tell you something&mdash;do you see that
college house of ours up on the hill? Well, under the
cornerstone of that building there are two things, and
I put them both there myself. One is my copy of old
John Calvin’s Institutes, and the other is a picture of
Polly Pendleton. That’s a right odd combination,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
isn’t it, to go under the cornerstone of a college?
Well, they’re both there.</p>

<p>“So now you know. As for me, I’ve got to finish
my education before I’m big enough and good enough
to teach or preach up there. It was you&mdash;not that
woman&mdash;made me feel that. It was <i>you</i> that taught
me how big and grand and sweet the world is, how
much there is to learn, how much there is to do. It
was <i>you</i> who have shown me how far I have to go.
I reckon it’ll be over hot plowshares, Ma’am. I’ve got
my ordeal yet ahead. May justice and not mercy be
mine in my ordeal.</p>

<p>“You’ve made it easier,” he added after a time, “a
heap easier. It’s only what the girl herself was trying
to tell me&mdash;but I couldn’t believe it. Another man’s?
No&mdash;I don’t share a woman with any other man on
earth. What’s mine is mine. What’s his may be his.
Let him rest up there on the hill. She’s dead, too, I
reckon, now. But you see, I didn’t know. I’m glad
you told me, Ma’am.”</p>

<p>“<i>Don’t</i> call me ‘<i>Ma’am</i>’!” exclaimed Marcia Haddon
suddenly. “I hate that word!” Without any explanation,
she rose and left him. She had seen the unveiling
of a stark human life, and had begun to measure
back her own life, her husband’s, with this whose
story she now had heard. Hot plowshares? Why,
yes, if need be. But that was his ordeal, and one that
he had earned. Were men indeed all alike?</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="pch">GRANNY WILLIAM’S NARRATIONS</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">DAVID JOSLIN did not come to renew his
invitation to Marcia Haddon to ride into
the mountains. She saw him no more. Nor
did she herself even yet keep her oft-renewed promise
to depart at once for the North. Moody and silent,
aloof and unhappy, this passed from one resolve to
another until one day Granny Williams, by chance,
offered a means for carrying out her own self-formed
plan of a visit deeper into the hills.</p>

<p>“I sartinly would enj’y it, child, fer to go back in
thar a ways with ye,” said Granny. “Three or four
of my boys lives up in Redbird, an’ I hain’t been in
thar fer a long time. We could ride up in one day
an’ stay a month, fer as that, if we wanted.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you afraid to go?” asked Marcia Haddon,
hesitating, knowing that the old lady would never see
her eightieth birthday again.</p>

<p>“Afeerd? Why should I be afeerd, womern? I
reckon I’ll never see the day when I’ll be afeerd to
ride a mewel that fer an’ back, if I want ter.” And,
indeed, when on the following day they embarked for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
their journey, the old dame herself sat carelessly, with
one skinny knee across the horn of her man’s saddle,
thrust almost up into her face as she perched, a bag
on one arm and a basket on the other, and smoked her
pipe in perfect contentment as she rode.</p>

<p>“Ye like enough don’t know much about mewels,”
said she, “bein’ a furrin womern. Mewels is best fer
the mountings. They’ll just walk along if ye leave
‘em be. All ye got to do is to foller right behind me,
an’ keep yore beast a-walkin’ right peart.”</p>

<p>The full foliage of the vernal season now covered
all the mountains. The stream, idling and loitering,
broke into rapids over rock ledges, or swum out into
wide, still pools under the far-flung fringes of the elms
and beaches. As they rode, Granny Williams told the
story of this place or that.</p>

<p>“Over in yander house,” she said, nodding her sunbonnet
in the direction indicated, “is a woman lives
that’s got six sons, ary one of ‘em over six foot two
inch tall. An’ not one of ‘em nuvver had a father. Old
times, folks that lived fer back in couldn’t always git a
preacher noways. Shouldn’t wonder if they got merried
some day even yit, now the railroad’s come. But
sakes! me a-talkin’ that way! I reckon I’d better
wet my finger an’ touch the top of my left air. Ye
see, Ma’am, if ye wet yore finger an’ rub the top of
yore left air, that makes folks bite their tongue when
they talk about ye. Didn’t ye know that? Ye furrin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
wimmern certainly is plumb ignorant, hain’t ye?”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Marcia Haddon, chuckling to herself.
“Tell me some more, Granny.”</p>

<p>“Not much to tell about these mountings, Ma’am&mdash;nothin’
ever did happen here much. Hit’s a settled
sort of country. Now, over thar ye see that pile of
logs, like? That’s whar Old Man Stallings used to
hev a barn. He never did git no roof on the barn,
nohow, though fer thirty year he was a-plannin’ about
it. He used to set right thar on that log jest below
the ridge, an’ look at that barn, an’ wish thar was a
roof on it. He done that fer thirty year, an’ then he
died. So that’s how come the barn to rot down that
way.</p>

<p>“Now, over yander on the creek is whar Preacher
Bonnell’s pa used to live. He was about the fightin’est
preacher we ever did have in here&mdash;always used to
ride with a Bible an’ a pistol an’ a bottle of liquor in
his saddlebags when he was out a-preachin’. One
day he rid twenty mile over the mountings to Newfound
jest to shoot a man. The co’te finded him
fifty dollars. That’s too much to fine a preacher. We
all allowed twenty dollars’d been plenty.</p>

<p>“Preacher Bonnell, he used to have a nigger man
a-workin’ fer him&mdash;onliest nigger ever was in these
hills, I reckon. We used to have ‘em here along atter
the war, but one time, come ‘lection, when they was
a-sellin’ their votes fer two dollars each, the folks paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
‘em off in counterfeit money. That riled the niggers,
an’ they done left.</p>

<p>“Speakin’ of old Preacher Bonnell, Ma’am,” she
went on reminiscently, “he was a odd sort of man.
Onct in a while he’d sort of take spells, like. He
didn’t speak to his wife fer nigh about five year, one
time. He used to shoot at a mark, and drink liquor
like all the other men folks. One time he bet eighty-four
twists of tobacco, agin a new wagon, that he
could beat Tomp Frame shootin’ at a mark. Tomp,
when Preacher Bonnell wasn’t lookin’, he cut his bullet
in two so he couldn’t hit nothin’. That’s how come
him to kill Tomp later, and git finded fifty dollars.
Hit made him so mad he couldn’t talk&mdash;he jest played
deef an’ dumb fer a long time. One day he set in a
game of keerds, an’ luck came his way, an’ he said right
out, afore he thought, ‘High, low, Jack an’ game, by
God!’ Ye see, he wasn’t always a preacher. He
wasn’t called ontel he was nigh about fifty year old, I
reckon.”</p>

<p>Her auditor turned away her face, so that her own
amusement might not be seen, and the old lady rambled
on, chewing at her pipe stem as she rode.</p>

<p>“Nothin’ nuvver happens in these hills, ye see,
Ma’am,” said she. “I hear tell, Outside, of picturs
that moves jest like they was alive. O’ course, that’s
a lie. But hain’t it funny how many things folks thinks
up? Now, we nuvver had no sich things as that when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
I was young. Fact is, I kain’t say as I ever had but
jest two kinds of amuse<i>ment</i>. One was to hear the
preacher tell about hell fire&mdash;he painted it up like a
lake of red, with yellow around the aidge. Other was
a picture a temper’nce preacher had all done in colors,
showin’ how a drunkard’s stomach looked. Hit was
red, too, like hell. I kin recollect even now about them
things&mdash;hell fire an’ the drunkard’s stomach. We
never had no other amuse<i>ments</i> but jest them. When
Old Man Bonnell got to a-<i>de</i>pictin’ hell fire, and shakin’
folks out over that, time them folks come forewerge!</p>

<p>“Over yander is whar Old Mammy Pierce
lives&mdash;&mdash;“ pointing to a small cabin by the wayside.
“She’s a granny womern&mdash;we call ‘em granny wimmern
that he’ps folks when childrens comes, ye know.
Her husband was a sort of doctor, too. He didn’t give
nothin’ but <i>nux vomic</i> very much. He says <i>nux vomic</i>
would fotch arything every time. He done killed
ummage of the stomach with <i>nux vomic</i>, an’ even tonsils.</p>

<p>“Now, jest beyant whar Mammy Pierce lives is whar
used to be Bill Coates’ house&mdash;ye kin see whar it
burned down. Me an’ my man was a-ridin’ right
along here when the house was a-burnin’, an’, well,
sir! Bill Coates was a-settin’ thar watchin’ it burn.
‘Sakes alive, man!’ says I to him, ‘why don’t ye put it
out?’ ‘Well,’ says he, ‘I sont my gal hafe a mile up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the creek to git a pail of water, an’ she hain’t come
back yit. That was more’n hafe a hour ago,’ ‘Pears
like the gal stopped to talk with some of the neighbors
up thar about how the house was a-burnin’ down, an’
time she got back it was too late.</p>

<p>“I wish’t we had time to ride up to Big Creek,
Ma’am. Thar’s a fine store up thar&mdash;travelin’ men
comes in thar from the other side, an’ sells all sorts of
goods thar. They carry their sample things in the
saddlebags same as Old Preacher Bonnell used to.</p>

<p>“But ye see, we kain’t read an’ write in these mountings.
The storekeeper, he always has kep’ his books
with marks, like, on the boards of his cabin. He
makes a short mark, like, fer two bits, an’ a long one
fer four bits, an’ he’ll have some sort of picture fer
each man that he’s a-trustin’ out goods to. Sometimes
he has to make signs fer to show what he’s done sold.
A few month ago Arch Morrison come in, and they
liken to have a diffikilty over his account. The storekeeper
said he’d sold Archie a cheese, an’ Archie he
done denied of it. ‘Thar’s a pictur of it,’ says the
storekeeper, an’ sure enough, thar was a big, round
thing like a cheese. ‘Oh,’ says Archie, ‘that hain’t no
cheese I bought. That’s a grindstone.’ ‘Shore enough,
Archie,’ says the storekeeper, ‘shore enough. I done
fergot to put the hole in it.’</p>

<p>“No, times is right qui’te in here, an’ always has
been, Ma’am! as ye kin see easy. In the fam’ly fightin’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
that’s a good many killings, but we hain’t had what
ye might call a real murder, not in sixty year. Ye see
that house acrosst the creek thar?&mdash;well, over thar,
sixty year ago, a fam’ly named Baker murdered a
feller named Pruitt fer some land an’ money he had.
That Baker woman sartinly was servigerous. Her man
hit Pruitt in the haid with a hammer, an’ they left him
out in the yard, but he come to. The old womern says,
‘Well, I’ll kill ye so ye’ll stay killed,’ So she taken
up a ax an’ cut off his haid. That was a long while
ago. Things like that don’t happen often. That was
murderin’, not killin’.</p>

<p>“Fact is, times is gittin’ qui’ter even at ‘lection and
co’te settin’s nowadays. Thar wasn’t nobody shot over
in Leslie County co’te settin’s last term, excusin’ Mose
Post. The depity sher’f, Wilson, went out to ‘rest
Mose. He was about the fightin’est man in them parts.
Mose was a-leanin’ aginst the fence when the depity
come up, an’ his gun got hung in the palin’ when he
pulled it, so the depity shot him a couple times. Hit
hain’t much like old time co’te settin’s when I was
young, Ma’am.</p>

<p>“No, I reckon it’s the new railroad that’s a-changin’
everything nowadays. We’re within twenty mile of
whar it’s a-goin’ acrosst the haid of Hell-fer-Sartin.
Folks says that farms is a-goin’ up right along nowadays,
an’ timber, too. Land didn’t useter have no value
here when I was a gal as old as ye air now. Folks jest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
moved out an’ set down on a piece of land, an’ cl’ared
it up like&mdash;that’s the way me an’ my man done. I’ve
seed a good farm sold fer a fiddle an’ a hog rifle&mdash;an’
now here’s that farm wuth they say maybe twenty-five
thousand dollars, ‘cause they found a little ile on it.
How much is twenty-five thousand dollars, anyway,
Ma’am?</p>

<p>“Times sartinly is changin’! Now, in my time I’ve
seed the hull upper part of Tejus Creek&mdash;they allowed
over two hundred thousand acres&mdash;sold fer a rifle an’
a bell-crowned hat. What ye reckon that land’s wuth
now, Ma’am?</p>

<p>“The Joslins had land over in thar, too, someone
tolt me. Fer matter of that, Davy like enough owns
or will heir from his granny a heap of land over on
Hell-fer-Sartin, besides the farm he give to Meliss’
over thar on Coal Creek, whar he used to live. He
nuvver would sell his land, an’ he nuvver would let his
granny do it neither. The blacksmith an’ the postmaster
tolt me that like enough when the railroad
comes Davy sartinly will be rich. I’ve knowed coal
rights to go fer five cents a acre, an’ old-time poplar
an’ oak timber fer a dollar an’ a hafe a acre. Yit folks
tells me that one log outen them trees would be wuth
ten or twelve dollar down at Windsor, maybe. Ye
reckon that’s so, Ma’am?</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks, I expect I’m a-makin’ ye tired,
a-talkin’ this way. I’m just a-narratin’ along, ‘cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
ye said ye wanted to larn somethin’ about our mountings.
I wish’t we had time to git up to Big Creek.
Thar’s a fam’ly of twelve people up thar, Ma’am, an’
every one of ‘em plays some kind of a musercal instru<i>ment</i>.
When all twelve of them people begins
to play ye’d think hell was a-poppin’, Ma’am. Didn’t
ye nuvver hear ary one of our old fiddle tunes?”</p>

<p>Marcia shook her head. “I’m afraid not,” she said.</p>

<p>“No? Why, Davy useter be a powerful fiddler in
his time, afore he got religion so hard. I reckon he
could play most all the old-time tunes. Didn’t ye
nuvver hear ‘Barbara Allen,’ or ‘Lord Lovell,’ Ma’am?
I’ve seen men set an’ cry over ‘Lord Lovell.’ Then
thar was ‘Polly Allen,’ another ballet. Thar was some
folks always that could make words fer ballets, an’
they’d sort of sing ‘em.</p>

<p>“As fer fiddlin’ tunes, thar’s so many I kain’t hardly
recollect. Thar was ‘The Flowers of Edingburg’&mdash;I
don’t know whar that come from, but they says it’s
old, an’ like enough come over the mountings. An’
thar was ‘The Deer Walk’&mdash;I don’t know whar that
come from neither. Then thar was ‘The Hog-Eyed
Man,’ an’ ‘Jawbone,’ an’ ‘The Puncheon Floor,’ an’
‘Jones’s Still House,’ an’ ‘Sugar in the Bowl,’ an’ ‘Suds
Over the Fence,’ an’ ‘Turkey in the Straw’&mdash;didn’t ye
never hear <i>none</i> of them tunes, Ma’am?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure, Granny,” rejoined Marcia Haddon.
“As you say, I’m powerful ignorant, and I’m afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
my education isn’t very wide in these matters. Go on
and tell me some more.”</p>

<p>“Well, thar was ‘Round the Sugar Tree’&mdash;that’s another
tune the boys played at dancin’s&mdash;and ‘Notchy
on the Hill.’ That tune come from the raftsmen.
They tolt us thar was a river called the Mississip’
somewhars, an’ a good many tunes come up from
down the Mississip’.</p>

<p>“Then thar was ‘Sally Ann,’ an’ ‘Ida Red,’ an’
‘Shreveport’&mdash;like enough ‘Shreveport’ come from the
raftin’ times, too. Then thar was ‘Dan Hogan’s,’ an’
‘Old Ned,’ an’ ‘Gall of the Yare’ (Guadalquivir?).
‘Polk an’ Dallas’ was a ‘lection tune. Then thar’s ‘The
Campbells Air Comin’,’&mdash;why, law! Ma’am, I could
go on a-tellin’ names of fiddlin’ tunes fer a hour yit.</p>

<p>“But hain’t this a purty country, Ma’am, we’re
a-goin’ through? I think it’s right purty, an’ I always
done so, from the time I was a gal, old as ye
air. Davy says he hain’t seen no purtier country’n
this, an’ he’s been Outside. I wonder how much land
he’ll heir from his granny&mdash;mother of Preacher Joslin?
She’s ninety-five year old, if she’s a day.
Wouldn’t it be strange if the new railroad would make
some of us pore folks rich atter all? Ye don’t know
much about Davy?”</p>

<p>Marcia Haddon had turned away her face from the
scrutiny of the old woman’s keen eyes, but the latter
went on:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>“I always did wonder what Davy done when he
went Outside. Do ye know? He sartinly come back
powerful changed. He useter be a right servigerous
kind of a man, like I said, the fightin’est of all the
fightin’ Joslins. But, shucks! he’s so different now ye
wouldn’t know the boy. He’s as mild as skim melk
He always was good to Meliss’, too. Her gittin’ a <i>di</i>vorce
from him when he was away&mdash;an’ all he was
a-tryin’ to do was to git a education so’s to he’p pore
folks like me! ‘Pears to me like Meliss’ Joslin got
entirely too much attention paid to herself along of
that divorce. She nuvver was so much noways. She
couldn’t neither spin nor weave wuth shucks, an’ besides,
her two babies both died on her. She wasn’t so
much.</p>

<p>“Law, I could tell ye a heap more things if ye liked
narratin’. Fer instant, here’s whar the men in my
grandad’s time chased the last two Injuns outen this
country, an’ kilt ‘em up on Redbird. This creek was
named atter one. Thar’s a hole up the river called
Jack’s Hole, whar the other was shot. One Injun was
named Red Bird, an’ the other they called Jack. They
cotched ‘em up above, but they used to live in a cave
round here, not far from whar we air now.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t Davy a-tellin’ ye about the cave whar the
two wanderin’ wimmern lives? Well, that’s the very
place whar them two Injuns useter live years ago.
Hain’t he never tolt ye about ‘em?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” said Marcia Haddon, content
with the one-sided conversation. “What about them,
Granny?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll show ye the very place right soon. Hit’s
jest beyant the two rocks that leans together, whar
Davy says some time he’s a-goin’ to start another
school. Hain’t he nuvver tolt ye about that neither?
Seems to me ye an’ him hain’t talked much noways.</p>

<p>“Well, now, them two wimmern is jest pore wild
folks, ye mought say. This cave is the onliest home
they’ve had fer years. The young woman is named
Min, an’ her little gal is named Min, too. She hain’t
got no pap, but she’s purty as a pictur, that little gal.”</p>

<p>“The poor child!” said Marcia Haddon. “Granny,
I almost wish I hadn’t heard so much.”</p>

<p>“Well, Ma’am, suppose ye was throwed down in
these mountings, with nothin’ to do with&mdash;what do ye
reckon ye’d do? About the best ye could, huh? I
reckon that’s what all of us folks has had to do&mdash;yes,
it’s jest what all of us folks has had to do. It’s what
everybody has got to do, come to that.</p>

<p>“Say, child, was ye ever merried more’n onct?”
Granny demanded suddenly. “I reckon ye was young
when ye was merried&mdash;ye hain’t larned much yit.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was young,” said Marcia Haddon. “And
once&mdash;only once.”</p>

<p>“Uh huh! Man jest come along an’ got foolish over
yore purty face, like enough, an’ talked fine to ye, an’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
so ye was merried! It goes that way. Well, I reckon
in a year or two ye’ll like enough merry again. Ye’re
gittin’ purtier every day. Some folks merries in lessen
a year, but hit hain’t ordinary helt decent to be in too
big a hurry.”</p>

<p>She went on, ruminatingly. “Me an’ my old man
has lived together a long while&mdash;I nuvver was merried
more’n only onct, neither. He’s so damn tough nothin’
couldn’t kill him, ‘pears like. He got a tree fall on
him, while ago, when he was turned fifty, an’ he hain’t
been much of a fightin’ man sence then, but still he’s
lived along sever’l year sence then, too.</p>

<p>“Well, now, what I was a-goin’ to say was, Ma’am,
supposin’ if he’d of died when I was, say, young as ye
air. Do ye suppose I’d of stayed single all of my life?
I don’t say if I would or I wouldn’t, but I’ve knowed
wimmern to merry four or five times, like enough&mdash;I
mought of merried sever’l times, come need fer’t. But
thank God I didn’t haveter.</p>

<p>“Didn’t ye never have no sweethearts afore ye
was merried, Ma’am?” she went on in her own fashion,
her inquisitiveness now growing under the reticence
of the other.</p>

<p>“Don’t all girls?” said Marcia Haddon soberly.</p>

<p>“Most has,” said the old dame, “mostly, yes. All,
ye mought say, that’s as purty as ye was. An’ as I
was sayin’, ye’re a-gittin’ purtier right along. Ye’ll
be a right peart-lookin’ widder afore long. Well, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
I was sayin’, ye mought of merried ary one of ‘em if
ye hadn’t of merried the man ye did.”</p>

<p>“It never came up for discussion in my mind,
Granny,” said Marcia Haddon with dignity.</p>

<p>“Huh! Thar’s most always two or three men in ary
womern’s life,” responded Granny Williams calmly.
“Thar was two or three in mine. Like enough I’d of
merried one of ‘em if I hadn’t of merried Henry like
I done. I been too busy to think about sich matters
sence. But, just so long as a woman is foot-loose like,
chances air she mought merry two or three men, or
even sever’l, like I said.”</p>

<p>Marcia Haddon made no response to this matter-of-fact
reasoning, but her ancient companion continued
in her monologue.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she chuckled, “that’s so. An’ yit, if ever a
man admits to his wife that he has ever saw more’n
one womern in all his borned life, she’ll raise hell with
him! Now, Davy&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Marcia Haddon suddenly pulled up her mule an’
hastened on, but relentlessly the old woman resumed
when she had come alongside.</p>

<p>“I was sayin’ about Davy&mdash;he were merried onlucky.
It jest happened that way. An’ now she’s got her a
divorce from him. That’s a awful thing.”</p>

<p>“We’ll talk of something else, Granny,” said Marcia
Haddon. The old dame looked at her keenly, curiosity
in her unseen glance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“An’ why not talk of Davy?” she insisted after a
time.</p>

<p>“I don’t wish to do so, Granny. It’s nothing to me
how he has married or what he does.”</p>

<p>“I reckon that’s so,” sighed Granny Williams.
“He’s only a mounting boy at that, though powerful
smart. Some said he hadn’t orter of ever left the
mountings, because he war the leader of his fam’ly&mdash;Chan
Bullock, he’s too young. Well, maybe they’re
right, an’ maybe they hain’t. They say the old quarls
is about all fixed up in here now&mdash;the whole country’s
changed come these last two year, now the railroad’s
comin’.”</p>

<p>“An’ Davy’s changed, too,” she went on. “He’s
sadder’n what he used to be. I don’t know as I ever
seed a man any sadder’n he is, especial right now. In
the old times he used to be the fightin’est, whisky-drinkin’est
young man in this here hull valley, an’ now
he’s got to be the workin’est man in all these parts. I
reckon it’s the <i>di</i>vorce that shames him. Not that I
suppose he’s a-seekin’ around anywhars for any more
merryin’&mdash;he like enough had his satisfy of gettin’
merried.”</p>

<p>Marcia Haddon did her best to change the conversation.
“You were telling me about a place where
they used to teach school long ago&mdash;right out of doors,
in the open,” said she.</p>

<p>“That’s furtherer on up the creek, beyant the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
ford whar the bufferlo come down to the salt lick in
my granddad’s time. That’s a purty place, right in
the bank of the creek. I’ll show it to ye some day.</p>

<p>“But now,” she resumed, as, turning the bend of the
road, they saw before them the blackened roof of a
deep cavern in the sidehill&mdash;“thar’s whar them wanderin’
wimmern lives I was tellin’ ye about, Ma’am.
Looks like thar wasn’t no one to home.”</p>

<p>But presently what appeared to be a little bundle of
rags far off at a back corner stirred, moved, and developed
itself into a very ragged little girl with very
tangled hair. She was perhaps seven or eight years
of age&mdash;a child with wide, dark eyes and white, even
teeth, as now they might see, for she smiled shyly as
they paused at the opening of the cave.</p>

<p>“Come here, Min,” said old Granny Williams.
“Come on out here an’ talk to the lady, won’t ye?”</p>

<p>The child came out, very slowly, shy as some wild
creature. She was clad now in a single-piece nondescript
garment, was barefooted, and her hair apparently
had never known comb or covering.</p>

<p>“Whar’s yore mammy at, Min?” demanded the old
lady.</p>

<p>The child made no answer; only stood twisting a toe
into the gravel of the roadway, painfully embarrassed
by the presence of this strange creature whose like she
never had seen in all her life.</p>

<p>“It’s only a furrin lady with fotched-on clothes,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
said old Granny Williams. “She won’t hurt ye.
Kain’t ye come an’ shake hands?”</p>

<p>“Yes, little girl, come,” said Marcia Haddon suddenly,
holding out her hand, and leaning forward with
so bright a smile that slowly the child came to her,
shyly extending her hand.</p>

<p>Marcia Haddon took the child’s hand in her own.
As she did so a strange emotion suddenly came upon
her&mdash;a primal glow at this touch of a child’s warm
hand in her own. Sudden tears came into her own
eyes&mdash;tears not unhappy, either; for now, in some way
unexplainable to herself, a whole, new, wide world
seemed to open all around her. In her own world of
ease, apart, she never yet had known or dreamed the
great, throbbing, vital things of life itself. But these
simple folk, poor, forgotten&mdash;they knew them all.
They were so far richer than herself. Their world
had been so much wider than her own.</p>

<p>The child stood looking shyly at her, like any wild
creature, her dark eyes wide and wistful, across them
passing alternate waves of light and shadow, as left
by a passing cloud upon the sky. But, moved though
she was to speak to the strange lady, she did not do
so. Only she stood looking up wistfully, and the
woman who sat above her looked down wistfully in
turn.</p>

<p>“Have ye had yore breakfast, Min?” asked Granny
Williams brusquely. The child shook her head, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
finger in her mouth now, her toe still twisting at the
earth.</p>

<p>“Well, well, hain’t that a shame! I reckon yore
mammy’s at the corn-hoein’ up to the big house in the
bottoms, hain’t she?”</p>

<p>The child nodded her head.</p>

<p>“Well, well, ye shall have somethin’ to eat.” The
old lady opened the top of the small basket which hung
on her arm, a basket which it was always her custom
to take to church with her for the sake of certain children
and grandchildren of her own. She drew out a
round cookie with a hole in the center, which she extended
to the child of the wandering women&mdash;the first
sweetmeat the little one had ever known in all her
life.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell yore mammy to bring ye down somethin’
to eat,” added Granny Williams. And so she clucked
to her mule.</p>

<p>The solitary occupant of the cave stood now in the
road, looking after them wonderingly, even the beloved
cookie arrested halfway between hand and mouth.</p>

<p>“Granny, what will become of a child like that left
here in these hills?” demanded Marcia Haddon after
a while. There was a half sob in her voice, though
still that strange, new, warm feeling in her heart.</p>

<p>“Why, she’ll go to hell, that’s what’ll become of
her,” said Granny promptly. “Excusin’ of that school
of Davy’s up thar on the hill, an’ what it kin do fer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
these childern, why, they’re all goin’ plumb to hell,
accordin’ to ary sort of preachin’ I ever did hear.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she went on reflectively, “thar’s a heap of
the onredeemed in these mountings, I reckon. Maybe
the railroad’ll make all the valleys alike&mdash;I hope so.
It may not come in my time. Davy says it’s a-comin’
right soon. I don’t know about them things.”</p>

<p>Marcia Haddon made no answer. She looked across
the tree-clad slopes of these rounded hills, trying to
visualize the point of view of that man, her husband,
who once had felt his own right to so much of this
country and its contents. Ownership of these hills, this
great world that lay about her undiscovered! Did,
then, the rights of sovereignty impose no duties in return?</p>

<p>“Granny,” said she suddenly, after they had traveled
for a time in silence.</p>

<p>“What is it, child?” asked the old dame gently.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose the mother of that child would let
her go away to school?”</p>

<p>“Do I suppose so?” ejaculated Granny Williams
fiercely. “Don’t I know she would? We been waitin’,
here in the Cumberlands. Jest waitin’. Lord ha’
massy on us.</p>

<p>“Look what Davy done,” she went on. “He war
only out a couple of year, an’ yit he changed complete,
ye mought say. I kain’t hardly understand him talk no
more, he talks so furrin, same’s ye. If Davy has went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
furrin, ‘pears like we all mought as well chirk up some
an’ git more furrin, too. The new railroad’ll sartinly
change a heap of things.</p>

<p>“Well, here we air at the gate of my cousin, right on
beyant. We’ll light down an’ stop here overnight,”
concluded Granny Williams at last, knocking the ashes
out of her pipe and thrusting it into her pocket. “Was
ye ever to school much in yore life, Ma’am?” she
demanded as she stood, her lean arm across her mule’s
neck.</p>

<p>“Yes, Granny,” replied the “furrin woman” gently.
“But I’ve learned more to-day, I think, than in all my
life before.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE DRUMS</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">WHEN, on the afternoon of a later day, Marcia
Haddon and her ancient chaperone re-entered
the long and straggling street at the
forks of the river, they noted certain signs of excitement.
A group of men was standing; others were hurrying
to the open space in front of the big store.</p>

<p>A striking sound came to their ears&mdash;a sound not
known in the Cumberlands for a generation&mdash;the throbbing
of a drum, the shrilling of a fife.</p>

<p>Upon a staff, upheld by the hand of one of a
little group of four men in uniform, was something
which focussed the eyes of all. It was the Flag&mdash;the
Flag for which the Cumberlands once had fought.</p>

<p>“Why, look-a-thar!” exclaimed Granny Williams,
hurrying up her mule. “I know them boys, all four of
‘em! It’s Jimmy an’ Willy Sanders, Tom Carswell,
an’ Grief Talley&mdash;all four of ‘em went out an’ ‘listed
more’n eight year ago, an’ been in the Army ever sense.
I’d like to know what fer they come in here now.”</p>

<p>Marcia Haddon could see posted up in the window a
flaming poster whose letters of red spoke loudly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
enough to all who could understand them: “<i>Your
country needs you!</i>”</p>

<p>Their country! Their country! It had forgotten
them all these years&mdash;these men who once had saved
the principle of freedom for a world&mdash;a world now
gone mad once more with blood and crying aloud now
again for aid in the salvation of that same principle.</p>

<p>“What is it, Ma’am?” demanded Granny Williams,
as they hurried on down the street. “What’s the paper
say?”</p>

<p>“It’s the war! They must be a recruiting party from
the Army,” said Marcia Haddon. “The paper in the
window says, ‘<i>Your country needs you!</i>’”</p>

<p>“It ‘pears to me I heerd some talk about thar bein’
fightin’ goin’ on Outside somewhar’s,” said Granny
Williams. “But what’s that got to do with us down
here? Ye don’t reckon the Govern<i>ment</i> needs us, do
ye?”</p>

<p>That was the message of this flaring placard hung
up for these, so few of whom could read; that was the
import of archaic drum and fife, and modern flag and
uniform&mdash;here in the far-off and forgotten Cumberlands.
“<i>Your country needs you!</i>”</p>

<p>Men came from all parts of the little settlement, attracted
by the sound of the music. They gazed dumbly
and vaguely at the sheet in the window, whose meaning
they knew from what these soldier boys told them&mdash;a
recruiting sergeant, a corporal, and two privates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
sent in from the district recruiting station on the railroad,
far away.</p>

<p>“Whar’s Davy?” asked old Absalom Gannt. “Someone
go git Davy. We got to look into this thing.”</p>

<p>Before David Joslin could be found, the two women
had turned in at Granny Williams’ home. Huddling
like fowls, all the women had taken to cover at the
alarm. The street was empty save for men and boys.</p>

<p>“What’s all this about, Davy?” asked old Absalom,
when presently Joslin joined them in the street. “Is
our Govern<i>ment</i> in this here?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said David Joslin. “It’s war! Our country’s
in it. That’s what it says.”</p>

<p>Someone handed him a newspaper, and he read its
headlines hurriedly, interpreting for them as he did so.
These men well enough knew what war was, or had
been&mdash;the traditions of their fathers told them. The
faces about him were serious now; no light remark
was ventured by any. Their eyes shifted from the
gaunt, lean face of David Joslin, as he read, to this little
fluttering emblem which stood driven in the mountain
airs.</p>

<p>“They’ve fired on our <i>Flag</i>!” said David Joslin to
them at last. “Our women and our children have been
killed by these&mdash;the enemy.”</p>

<p>A low murmur, amounting to a growl in sum, rose
from the group of men. Silently they gathered more
closely about him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>“Shot at our <i>flag</i>?” said old Absalom Gannt&mdash;“an’
wimmern and children&mdash;that kain’t be! That hain’t
<i>right</i>.”</p>

<p>“But it’s true,” said David Joslin. “We’ll have to
fight.”</p>

<p>“Ye’re damn right we’ll have to fight!” said Absalom.
“Our Govern<i>ment</i> kain’t stand <i>that</i>.”</p>

<p>“The sergeant here will tell you,” went on David
Joslin, after a time. “The Government wants volunteers,
up to forty&mdash;that’ll let me in. It may be some
of you boys will want to go along. Maybe it’s our
time come at last!”</p>

<p>And now, all at once, swiftly, exultantly, gloriously
unrestrained, the full gift of tongues fell upon David
Joslin, as he stood there in the open street of a mountain
village in a forgotten land! Suddenly the clouds
cleared in front of him. He saw, and was content
now with what he saw. Now he knew his life had not
been in vain; that yet it might be of worth; that on
ahead, if he should be spared to win it, lay the great,
wide education of life and citizenship, and a share in
the building and the keeping of a world! He spoke
in such fashion that all his own longings, his own
yearnings for his country and his people became apparent
to them now, so that they listened in trust and
awe and reverence; as well as in somber anger when
he swung to the great summons. Had there been
David Joslins throughout the land, the American Army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
had been a matter of a week, a day, and we had not
been laggard in Freedom’s great day of peril.</p>

<p>“There’s goin’ to be a draft, a conscription,” said
the sergeant in explanation after a time.</p>

<p>“Draft be damned!” said Absalom Gannt, and spoke
the mind of all. “Thar kain’t nobody draft us, not
even the Govern<i>ment</i>. We’ll go ahead of ary draft.”</p>

<p>“They won’t let you go, Absalom. You’re too old,”
said Sergeant Talley to him, smiling.</p>

<p>“Too old! Who&mdash;me? I’d like to see ary man tells
me I’m too old to fight,” rejoined that stark citizen.</p>

<p>“Twenty-one to thirty-one,” smiled Sergeant Talley.
“Up to forty, if you volunteer.”</p>

<p>“Well, that lets me in, anyway,” said Chan Bullock,
and there were nods through the little crowd.
Only the older men turned face to face, shaking their
heads.</p>

<p>“It hain’t no ways reas’ner’ble to let the boys go
alone,” said old Absalom Gannt. “It hain’t no ways
right, an’ it wouldn’t do&mdash;we’ll all go out together,
that’s what we’ll do! Davy Joslin, ye’ll have to go,
too&mdash;I reckon ye’ll have to lead us&mdash;Outside.”</p>

<p>“Well, we could make up a band of men,” said Sergeant
Talley, hesitating, “and go over to the examining
officers at the station. A day’s march, maybe.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk!” said Absalom. “We’ll all go out
together. Davy, tell me,” and he turned to him suddenly,
“who is it we’re a-fightin’ with?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>And David told him as well as he might, suiting
what he said to the understanding of these who heard.</p>

<p>“Give us a day, Sergeant, to fix things up at home,”
suggested Joslin now. “We’ll not keep you long.”</p>

<p>“Look at them <i>old</i> guys,” grumbled the smart sergeant
to his corporal, aside. “We don’t want them
along, but it don’t look like we could head them off.”</p>

<p>The color-bearer picked up his flag once more. The
drummer pulled around his slings, and the fifer
handled his instrument. The throb of the drum, the
high note of the fife, passed down the street to yet another
stand. And behind them, ragged, gaunt, unkempt,
somewhat uncouth, fell in the band of the lost
children, the men of the Cumberlands, now following
the Flag, which had so long forgotten them.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="pch">STRANGERS WITHIN THE GATES</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE civic center of the village at the river forks
might have been called the long building, in
which were located the post-office and the
blacksmith shop. It was here that, on the morning
following, old Granny Joslin stood in the door, pipe
in mouth, looking up the long street, which rambled
down from the hills. Her gaze was fixed upon the
approaching vehicle commonly known as the mail stage.
It seemed to carry passengers this morning, an unusual
thing, and the passengers themselves were such
as to attract special attention of Granny Joslin and
others.</p>

<p>That they were “furriners” Granny Joslin would
have pronounced long ago. There were two women,
both young, and their apparel, had it been worn by any
of these parts, would distinctly have been recognized
as “fotched on.”</p>

<p>The two young women climbed down, unassisted,
from the vehicle, and stood, perhaps as extraordinary
a pair as ever had been seen thereabouts, in the dust
of the street, looking about them curiously. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
younger of the two, with hands in pockets and feet
just a trifle wide apart&mdash;a trim young woman and
noticeable anywhere&mdash;was clad in well-cut traveling
garb and tailored hat. She caught now in her gaze the
old woman, who leaned against the side of the post-office
door, silent and motionless, regarding these newcomers.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Grandma,” said she, not pertly, but
with a certain easy assurance, which seemed to go naturally
with her.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Ma’am,” replied Granny Joslin, still with
her pipe in her mouth.</p>

<p>“Is this the town,” continued the young woman, “and
if it isn’t, where is it?”</p>

<p>“I reckon’s as much as ary other place,” admitted
Granny.</p>

<p>“And where’s the hotel?&mdash;the driver said there
wasn’t any.” The latter, shaking his head, mystified,
had stepped within, carrying his meager mailsacks.</p>

<p>“Hotel? Tavern, you mean? Well, now, he’s done
tolt ye the truth, Ma’am. There hain’t no tavern here,
none at all.”</p>

<p>“What! And we’ve ridden twenty miles from the
railroad because we couldn’t find anything fit to eat
there.”</p>

<p>“It’s tougher the furtherer in ye git,” said Granny
Joslin. “Ye orter see Hell-fer-Sartin, Ma’am. Ye’re
from the North, I reckon?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>The young woman nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon Granny Williams will take ye in,
like enough. She’s got another furrin womern in thar
now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right&mdash;that will be fine. Do you know what
her rates are?”</p>

<p>“Rates, Ma’am?”</p>

<p>“How much she charges by the day, or maybe
longer.”</p>

<p>The old lady looked at her silently for some time,
but at length answered with a certain calm dignity of
her own.</p>

<p>“I don’t reckon nobody would charge ye nothin’ fer
what ye et while ye was in here, Ma’am,” said she.
“Ye’d be welcome.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of that, Nina?” chuckled the
spokesman of the two new arrivals.</p>

<p>She turned again to the old woman. “Well,” said
she politely, “we want to do what’s right. I just
thought I’d ask you, you know. We’re strangers here,
all right enough. We wouldn’t plan to stay long&mdash;maybe
not more than a day or two.”</p>

<p>“Who air ye?” demanded Granny Joslin succinctly.
“Have ye heerd anything about the war outside? I
heerd tell thar was some sort of diffikilty we-all was
havin’ with some other folks somewhars. I come down
to see.”</p>

<p>“War! Have we heard of the war! I should say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
we hadn’t heard of anything else!” rejoined the young
woman. “It’s put a crimp in business, all right&mdash;especially
our business.”</p>

<p>“What is yore business, Ma’am?” queried the old
dame.</p>

<p>“We’re players&mdash;actors&mdash;don’t you see?&mdash;theatrical
people&mdash;you know. And we’ve lost a perfectly good
angel. That’s why we’re here.”</p>

<p>This statement likewise seemed to Granny Joslin a
most extraordinary one. She made no comment, as the
speaker went on, feeling a trifle angered in the suspicion
that these others were making sport of her.</p>

<p>“Well, it was the war that did that,” said the young
woman. “And here we are.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, Madam,” began the older of the two newcomers,
seeing the perplexity of the old lady, “do you
know of any one in here lately by the name of Haddon?”</p>

<p>Granny Joslin bent the calm gaze of her deep-set
hazel eyes upon her.</p>

<p>“The furrin womern over to Granny Williams’
house is name Haddon,” said she after a time, “but
her man, he hain’t here no more now.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t here! Has he been here? When did he
leave?” It was the younger woman who spoke again.</p>

<p>“He lef’ a while back.”</p>

<p>“Where did he go? Do you know?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. The Lord only knows whar he went,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
but he’s daid all right. Up yander on the hill is whar
he’s buried at. His womern has been stayin’ on here
fer a little while yit, over to Granny Williams’, like I
done tolt ye.”</p>

<p>Her close scrutiny saw consternation upon the faces
of both the newcomers.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;you don’t mean Mr. Haddon&mdash;you don’t
mean that Mr. James Haddon&mdash;<i>he</i> isn’t dead, is he?”</p>

<p>“He sartinly is,” replied Granny Joslin. “He was
drownded down to the Narrers while he was a-comin’
in here. They had a boat an’ they come up from
Windsor. Davy&mdash;that’s my grandson&mdash;saved the
corp, and he had a moughty hard time doin’ it, too, let
me tell ye. He liken to have drownded hisself. But
Davy, he fotched the corp, anyways.”</p>

<p>The two strangers looked at one another, horrified.</p>

<p>“We heard he came in that way,” began the younger
woman. “You see, we knew him very well. We wired
to New York&mdash;don’t you see, he was our partner, the
backer of our company, as they say&mdash;we had a theatrical
company on the road. Well, they told us he had
started in for this place here. Then we didn’t get any
more word from his office. We weren’t so far away
from here by rail, so we started over&mdash;of course, if
we’d come in the same way he did we would have
heard of it&mdash;but we didn’t. You see, Mr. Haddon was
in business with us. Dead?&mdash;why&mdash;why&mdash;what’ll we
<i>do</i>?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>The old lady still regarded them both fixedly, her
pipe still between her lips.</p>

<p>“What’s yore name, Ma’am?” said she after a time.
“Ye’re mighty purty, ‘pears like to me.”</p>

<p>“They call me Polly Pendleton, Grandma,” said the
young woman. “I don’t know your name&mdash;we don’t
know anything at all. What you say to us is terrible&mdash;it’s
awful.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s right hard,” admitted Granny Joslin.
“Say, Ma’am, tell me, did ye ever meet a young man
from these parts? An’ tell me, furthermore, air ye
French and Irish mixed?”</p>

<p>Polly Pendleton suddenly flushed to her eyes.
“What makes you ask that?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“I reckoned ye was,” replied the old dame quietly.
“Ye jest about come under a tall man’s arm, too, don’t
ye? Ye’re purty as a pictur. I don’t know as I ever
seed a purtier gal than ye, lessen it’s the furrin woman
over thar at Granny Williams’ house right now. I’m
French and Irish myself, too, Ma’am.”</p>

<p>“How odd! I say, Grandma, what’s your name&mdash;since
we’re getting acquainted now?”</p>

<p>“My name’s Joslin, Ma’am. That thar young man
I meant was Davy, my grandson, the same thet built
the school buildin’ up yander on the hill&mdash;biggest building
ever was in these mountings. Now, I’ve heerd
Davy talk of ye afore now, Ma’am. But I reckon ye’ve
come in here fer another sort of man than Davy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>“Rather!” said Polly, a smile suddenly coming upon
her troubled face in spite of all. “But Joslin&mdash;David
Joslin&mdash;why, of course&mdash;I’ve seen him, yes. You’re
right&mdash;we didn’t come in here after him.”</p>

<p>The look of genuine perturbation upon the faces of
the two young women proved to the ancient dame that
the news they had heard was serious enough for them,
whatever cause there might be. Polly Pendleton’s
dark eyes were a trifle dimmed as she turned once
more.</p>

<p>“We’re sorry&mdash;we’re as sorry as we can be, Grandma,”
said she. “We hadn’t any idea he was even
sick. I don’t know what to do. But I think we’ll
have to go back as soon as we can.”</p>

<p>“Ye kain’t git back afore to-morrer,” said Granny.
“But the fustest thing to do is to come in an’ git something
to eat. We’ll go over to Granny Williams’. Ye
must be tired, the both of ye. The roads is awful.”</p>

<p>The shrug of Polly’s shoulder was endorsement
enough for this general statement, and Nina, usually
the more silent, employed likewise now an eloquent exclamation.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe the furrin womern has come back
from up in the hills yit,” said Granny Joslin.</p>

<p>She did not note the sudden relief which came upon
the face of at least one of her auditors. “But that
don’t make no difference,” she resumed. “Thar’ll be
plenty of room fer ye. If ye was up in my country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
now, I’d have ye come home with me, but it’s ten mile
up the creek. I jest walked down this mornin’ along
of my mewel takin’ sick a few days back.”</p>

<p>“You walked&mdash;ten miles!”</p>

<p>“I sartinly did. But like I said, ye kain’t walk that
fer, bein’ furriners. Why, chile, frail-like as ye air,
ye’d be plumb beat out by that time, an’ so would
yore sister here&mdash;ye said yore sister, didn’t ye?”</p>

<p>“She’s more than that,” said Polly Pendleton.
“She’s the only friend I’ve got now. We’re both
awfully obliged to you, Mrs. Joslin. We certainly
are. We’d do as much for you.”</p>

<p>“I believe ye would, myself,” said Granny Joslin
simply. “Ye’ll be welcome here, so fer as what we
got to give ye. We’re all alike.”</p>

<p>Polly Pendleton was pausing for a moment’s
thought. “We hadn’t the slightest idea in the world,
of course, or we’d never have come here. We&mdash;I don’t
think we want to bother Mrs. Haddon, you know.
She’d rather be alone, I’m sure.” She held back, hesitating.</p>

<p>“She’s a fine womern, Ma’am, accordin’ to Davy,”
rejoined the old woman. “He says she’s the finest he
ever seed, and he’s been Outside and seed a power of
things in his time, Davy has.”</p>

<p>“Well,” broke in Polly Pendleton, now with a certain
asperity, “one thing, she can’t be any hungrier
than I am right now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>“So long as ye kin eat ye’re a-goin’ to survive your
sorrer, Ma’am, I always heerd,” rejoined Granny Joslin
grimly. “Well, come along. We all got to die
some time, come to that.”</p>

<p>She placed her pipe in her pocket now, after knocking
out the ashes, and started out forthwith in the
lead, her bent and bony body, shrunken and battered
under the weight of years and infirmity, scarce as tall
as Polly Pendleton by half a head. Her course was
across the street along which, further down, lay the
house of Granny Williams.</p>

<p>“Well, Nina, old dear,” commented Polly, <i>sotto
voce</i>, as they followed, “things couldn’t be much worse,
could they? Poor chap&mdash;isn’t it a horrible thing?
And we never knew a word!”</p>

<p>Her uncommunicative comrade only nodded, her
face drawn into lines none too happy now, for
she it was, of the firm of Pendleton and Stanton,
who usually was the more concerned with the business
affairs.</p>

<p>“And here’s his wife in here, too&mdash;that makes it a
lot harder,” she said at length. “I’ve a picture of
how much she loves you, Polly! There’s plenty of
places I’d rather be in than right here now, my
dear!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m hungry,” resumed Polly once more, trying
to shake off care, as always. “Is this the place,
Grandma?” she added, hurrying up now and giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
a hand to the old dame’s elbow, as she turned in at
the steep walk behind the gate.</p>

<p>“It’s the place, Ma’am,” said Granny Joslin. “Come
on in. Whether Granny Williams is home or not ye’ll
be welcome in her house. It hain’t never locked.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE UNCERTIFIED</p>

<p class="drop-cap07">GRANNY JOSLIN was accurate in one statement
regarding her neighbor’s household, but
was not so accurate in other details. Had
Polly Pendleton known surely that Marcia Haddon
was in the house she now approached, she certainly
must have turned and gone the other way. And had
Marcia herself suspected the presence in town of these
two visitors of all in the world, it is most likely that
she would have prolonged her visit in the hills indefinitely,
and not have returned earlier in the day, as had
been the case.</p>

<p>In her room, Marcia Haddon heard voices&mdash;voices
of the two old women, voices of two younger women&mdash;one
voice which caused her to stop and listen&mdash;all
her faculties arrested.</p>

<p>It was Granny Williams who after a time knocked
at her door and called her out to meet the newcomers.
Marcia, with sudden prescience of what was to come,
summoned all her fortitude for what seemed to her
the unkindest blow she ever had known of fate. This
woman&mdash;here&mdash;following her to the edge of the world&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
her husband’s very grave-side&mdash;it was a thing
unspeakable in its unfitness! Her very soul rebelled
against it.</p>

<p>Her color was high as she stepped out into the
room, facing what she felt must be an encounter.
“You asked for me?” said she, looking directly into
the face of Polly Pendleton. “I think there must be
some mistake.” Her eyes now passed calmly from
one to the other, her face cold.</p>

<p>Polly, quick of wit, did what she could. “Mrs.
Haddon,” said she impulsively, “we didn’t know you
were here when we came in. We didn’t know you
were in town. It’s all a mistake&mdash;everything’s a mistake.
We wanted to go away right now&mdash;but they
wouldn’t let us&mdash;there’s no other place for us. Won’t
you let me talk to you now? May we&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Her gesture indicated the room from which Marcia
had but now emerged, which seemed to offer privacy
for what Polly Pendleton as well as herself knew was
to be a scene.</p>

<p>“As you like,” said Marcia Haddon icily, and held
open the door, closing it as the other entered.</p>

<p>“It’s all a mistake, Mrs. Haddon,” began Polly
once more as she found herself alone with the other.</p>

<p>“So it would seem,” replied Marcia, still coldly.
“Not one of my own making.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t know a thing about it, Mrs. Haddon.
I’m sorry, awfully sorry&mdash;sorry as I can be.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>“You would seem to have cause for regret, perhaps?
I suppose you refer to my husband’s death?”</p>

<p>Polly nodded rapidly, her upper lip trembling a
little bit. The situation was not in the least easy for
her.</p>

<p>“I can fancy it would mean something to you.”</p>

<p>“A lot,” said Polly frankly, “an awful lot. But
what’s the use! He was backing us, of course, you
know that&mdash;had been for a long while. We wanted
help&mdash;we’re on our uppers now. We heard he was in
here, and we came in ourselves to have a little talk
with him over things. We were over on the railroad,
don’t you see? We’ve had bad business all along for
weeks. The war knocked us out. Oh, I tell you, we
knew nothing about <i>this</i>&mdash;we hadn’t heard of any accident.
And Jimmy was such a good chap!”</p>

<p>“I presume you refer to my husband when you say
Jimmy? Yes?” Marcia’s voice was not only icy, but
worse.</p>

<p>“Well,” resumed Polly uneasily, “I’ve known him
for a long time, you see.”</p>

<p>“I know all about the length&mdash;and the nature&mdash;of
your acquaintance with my husband, Miss Pendleton.”</p>

<p>“My real name is Amanda Brown,” said Polly,
calmly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Brown? I don’t know whether or not
my husband has made any provision for you in his
will. I haven’t been made fully acquainted with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
nature of his will. My lawyers have asked me to
come back at once, but I have been stopping on here.
It was hard&mdash;I was not quite ready to go away from
him. He needed some one to watch him, don’t you
think?</p>

<p>“Now,” she went on, “I have been obliged to meet
you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Polly, with a shrug, “we wouldn’t have
been so apt to meet back in the city.”</p>

<p>“Hardly, I fear.”</p>

<p>Polly reddened a little at this. “You don’t like me,
Mrs. Haddon, do you?” said she directly.</p>

<p>“Why should I?”</p>

<p>“That’s right&mdash;why should you, when it comes to
that? I’m not sure that I should if it were the other
way about But one thing is sure&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Need we discuss these matters at all? I don’t see
why. This whole situation is not in the least of my
making, or my liking.”</p>

<p>“Oh, now, listen, Mrs. Haddon! I know a lot of
things. I’m not what you are&mdash;I never had your
chance. I’ve done the best I could with what I had,
the same as you, maybe. If I had married him you’d
never have taken him away from me!”</p>

<p>“Indeed?” Her auditor did not even smile.</p>

<p>“Women like you,” broke out Polly, waxing somewhat
tremulous herself&mdash;“women like you don’t know
anything about women like me. I didn’t run after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
Jimmy Haddon&mdash;he ran after me. Why did he?
What made him? Didn’t you have every chance in
the world to keep him? Who’s to blame&mdash;me or you
or him&mdash;or all of us? I wasn’t running after him
so much even now. Of course I didn’t know anything
about what has happened, or I wouldn’t have
come.”</p>

<p>Marcia’s hands were intertwining nervously now.
“Do you think I ought to talk to you at all now&mdash;coming
here as you do&mdash;following him absolutely into
his grave?”</p>

<p>“I wish you wouldn’t,” said Polly, coloring hotly
now. “Maybe I’m not as bad as you think&mdash;or anyway,
different. If men drift to my sort, how can my
sort help it? I’m only a rag and a bone and a hank
my own self, I suppose. If it hadn’t been him it would
have been someone else, maybe. If it hadn’t been me,
maybe it would have been someone else for him too&mdash;that’s
the way it goes.”</p>

<p>Marcia Haddon was looking at the young woman
before her with a new and strange feeling of curiosity,
trying after her own ancient creed to be fair, to be
just. She was trying now to understand, to find as
much good as possible in the careless self-accusation
of the young person who spoke thus artlessly and
directly. But that young person went on now somewhat
bitterly.</p>

<p>“We’re a good ways apart, Mrs. Haddon, I expect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
I hadn’t a thing to start with but my laugh and my
looks&mdash;they would have left me comfortable if I’d
never met your husband. If he’s gone now, all the
better for me now, like enough, and all the better for
him&mdash;and maybe for you too. You don’t know about
my sort. Well, I don’t ask that of you. There’s milk,
and fresh milk, and bottled milk, and certified bottled
milk. You’re strictly respectable&mdash;you’re certified&mdash;you’re
the sort that’s been taken care of all their lives.
Me&mdash;I’m uncertified, I guess. It doesn’t make much
difference to anybody now, does it? I told&mdash;him&mdash;another
man&mdash;I was going over with the Red Cross.”</p>

<p>Still striving to be just in spite of all, Marcia Haddon
held her speech, looking gravely at the other, who
now went on, unsparing alike of herself and her
hearer.</p>

<p>“It’s late to give you a tip about how to handle a
husband&mdash;but I could have&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” said Marcia Haddon. “I’m afraid
there’s nothing you can do for me. I’m afraid&mdash;well,
I suppose I ought to try to be fair, even now.” She
could not refer directly in speech to the relations between
the dead yonder and the living here.</p>

<p>“That never gets anybody very much,” said Polly
Pendleton. “You remind me of that chap that came
into my place in New York&mdash;Joslin, his name was&mdash;he’s
the grandson of this old lady that brought us in
here!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>Now for the first time the slow red of anger rose
to Marcia Haddon’s face.</p>

<p>“I think you’ve said quite sufficient about that and
many other matters,” said she. “You certainly can’t
discuss Mr. Joslin with me&mdash;I’ll not have it. In fact,
I’m not sure that you can discuss anything with me
any longer.”</p>

<p>“I’ve asked no odds of you,” she flared out, at last.
“If you took my husband from me, you took my leavings&mdash;there
was nothing about him that I cared for
any more. Anything worth trying for&mdash;anything
worth fighting for&mdash;why, yes&mdash;I don’t know that I’d
need fear you so much. You came into my life not
by my invitation, but I’m not so sure you need ask
me so much for forgiveness. What have I to forgive&mdash;or
you? He’s dead now&mdash;he’s gone from both
of us. You’re welcome to what you had.”</p>

<p>Her gaze unconsciously passed beyond the window,
up to the hillside where lay a little mound, a rude stone
at the head.</p>

<p>“We’ll not say anything evil about him now&mdash;more
than we have. He’s found the way out, even if we
haven’t as yet for ourselves. Our ways must part,
of course. But you can’t advise me and you can’t
glory over me. You’ve had my leavings. Is that
quite plain?</p>

<p>“And now the way is plain for all of us&mdash;at last.”
Her voice was trembling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>It was like Marcia Haddon to stand erect, her features
controlled, though tears dropped from her eyes.
And it was like Polly Pendleton to grasp both her
hands and kiss her, when, sobbing, she fumbled for her
small belongings as she turned to go.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE SEEKING</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE unusual sounds of the street still came to
the ears of all in the little village, but Marcia
Haddon, agitated, held to her own room and
tried to rest, to forget. She was aroused by the sudden
advent of Granny Williams herself.</p>

<p>“Come on out here, Ma’am,” said that worthy. “I
want ye to meet Davy’s granny&mdash;old Granny Joslin.
She’s come down to talk things over to-day. Them two
young wimmern has went away. They said they
couldn’t stay, so I sont ‘em over to the blacksmith’s
to stop. So set down an’ talk to Davy’s granny,
Ma’am.”</p>

<p>Marcia was not prepared for the vision that met
her gaze. Old Granny Joslin was old, very much older
even than Granny Williams, more bent, less active,
more afflicted by the blows of life and fate. Indeed,
of late, Granny Joslin had seemed to all scarce so
savage as of old, a trifle more bent than she had
been in all her life before. Her eye was less fierce, as
now she took the young woman’s hand in her own
skinny, horny palm and looked into her eyes as straight
as a hawk might.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>“So ye air the furrin womern that Davy tolt me
about,” said she. “Well, ye’re right purty, that’s
shore.”</p>

<p>“Hain’t she, though!” affirmed Granny Williams.
“Hain’t she, though!&mdash;an’ gittin’ purtier right along.
If only she’d taken a few doses of camomile an’ sage,
I’d ‘a’ had her ready by now so’s she could do a day’s
work. She’s powerful triflin’, Granny.” Even old
women called Granny Joslin “Granny,” for she was
older than the oldest of them.</p>

<p>But Granny Joslin for some reason seemed softened
quite beyond her wont. “I’m glad to see ye, Ma’am,”
said she. “I’m sorry ye lost yore man down at the
Narrers. Hit’s a powerful mean place fer a man to
git in&mdash;thar’s a heap of graves around thar&mdash;men
lost from the rafts at the Narrers. Davy’s tolt me,
many’s the time.”</p>

<p>Marcia Haddon did not make any response.</p>

<p>“Davy tolt me all about ye, too,” continued the
old woman. “I know ye must be moughty lonesome
in here. When air ye goin’ back, Ma’am?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Marcia Haddon. “I’ve been
here longer than I had planned&mdash;I ought to go any
time&mdash;I must go now.”</p>

<p>“Did ye hear the playin’ in the street right now?”
asked the old woman suddenly. “Has the war came
up North as well as here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Joslin. It’s an awful, awful thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” rejoined that worthy dame.
“Men jest has to do a sartin amount of fightin’ aryways,
an’ now they kin git plenty. They’d orter.
Davy was the head man of our fam’ly ontel he went
away, an’ then Chan Bullock, he taken it on&mdash;an’ now
not even Chan seems to hev ary bit of sand left.
Ma’am, he’s been livin’ right along here, they tell me,
sleepin’ right alongside of old Absalom Gannt, an’ he
nuvver got him yit!</p>

<p>“I jest sort of wandered in town to-day to see what
I could do my own self. An’ now what do I see?
Why, old Absalom Gannt an’ David Joslin an’ Chan
Bullock a-marchin’ down the street arm in arm, ye
mought say, follerin’ the music! What kin I do? I
say, the war it’s a massy&mdash;jest so old Absalom gits
killed somewhar, I don’t keer how it happens!”</p>

<p>“They’re brave men,” said Marcia Haddon, her
eyes suddenly kindling. “Why, look what he did&mdash;your
grandson&mdash;down there at the Narrows.”</p>

<p>“Well, he anyways saved the corp,” assented Granny
Joslin, nodding. “Like enough couldn’t no man of
done much more’n that.”</p>

<p>“Davy’s a-goin ‘out, I reckon,” said Granny Williams
now, reaching for a coal for her pipe, and offering
it in turn to the other old dame, still held between
the tips of her horny fingers.</p>

<p>“Of course he’ll go,” grumbled his granddam.
“Joslins kain’t stay out’n ary war. I reckon that’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
put a stop to his colledge up on the hill, huh? We got
to wait now till we lick them Dutch a-plenty&mdash;they
tell me it’s the Dutch we’re a-goin’ to fight.”</p>

<p>“If thar ever was any talk that Davy was a-skeered,”
commented Granny Williams presently, “I reckon it’ll
be stopped now.”</p>

<p>“Nobody but a fool would ever say a Joslin was
a-skeered of arything!” broke out the other old dame
fiercely. “If he was a-skeered, would he of done called
them people together down at the mill house a purpose
to taken a shot at him if they wanted ter? If he was
a-skeered, would he of went up to the door of the
stillhouse, come two year back, an’ called old Absalom
out? Only pity is he didn’t kill Absalom then&mdash;well,
as I said, jest so Absalom gits killed some way, I hain’t
no wise pertic’lar.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Granny,” nodded Granny Williams
with approval, shifting her cob pipe to her hand.
“That’s the proper sperrit of a Christian. An’ I like
to hear ye say it thataway.”</p>

<p>“Well,” she went on, sighing, “our own fam’ly
hain’t got skercely a quarl left no more, sence my son
Andy kilt the last Purrin over on Newfound a few
year back. If I was sitiwated like ye air, Granny,
I’d feel jest the same as ye do. I kin forgive all them
Purrins now jest as easy as not&mdash;sence they’re all daid.
Forgiveness is what they preach in the church house.</p>

<p>“But now, Granny”&mdash;as the older woman sat staring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
moodily into the fire&mdash;“how come hit that yore
Davy hain’t nuvver had no speakin’ yit down to the
church house at the Creek? We’re jest perishin’ in
here fer some right good preachin’. Onct in a while
Preacher Bonnell he opens a meetin’ fer three or four
days, an’ sometimes Old Man Parkins from up Redbird,
he comes round here in his circuit. An’ thar’s
a young man over in Leslie that they say is right promisin’,
an’ he mought come over afore long. But thar
hain’t been to say no religious <i>awakenin’</i> in here, so
to speak, fer a long time. An’ Davy&mdash;ye know he
started out fer to be a preacher, him with his education
an’ all. Why don’t he <i>preach</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes, why don’t he?” demanded Granny Joslin savagely.
“I taken that all up with Davy, an’ I kain’t do
a damn thing with him. He says&mdash;well, what do you-all
think he says to me?”</p>

<p>“I kain’t guess,” said Granny Williams. “He’s always
been odd.”</p>

<p>“He says he ain’t <i>good</i> enough to preach!” exclaimed
the fierce old woman who turned towards her.
“He says, ‘I hain’t got my edication yit,’ says he to
me.”</p>

<p>“Men is natural cantankerous,” said Granny Williams,
nodding her head sagely. “Why the Lord made
‘em that way, the Lord only knows.”</p>

<p>“Davy won’t have no chance to preach anyhow if
he goes to the war,” resumed Granny Joslin. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
reckon the school’ll all go to hell now. Has he said
ary thing to ye about the school, Ma’am?” She turned
suddenly now to Marcia Haddon.</p>

<p>“No,” rejoined that individual, somewhat startled;
“nothing at all. I’ve not seen him for several days.”</p>

<p>“He tolt me ye was the wife of the man that owned
the Company&mdash;an’ the Company owns all this land in
here. Well, like I said, I reckon that school’ll have
to go to hell now&mdash;an’ yit we certainly did need it&mdash;that
school. Hit was&mdash;<i>our</i> school, the fustest in the
Cumberlands.”</p>

<p>Marcia Haddon vouchsafed no comment, and presently
old Granny Joslin rose.</p>

<p>“Well, I got to be gittin’ on, Sarah Alice,” said she
to her friend. “I want to find Davy somewhar&mdash;I’ve
brung him down some caraway cookies. He always
liked ‘em. An’ I brung him a clean handkerchief&mdash;he’s
got to have a heap of things if he’s a-goin’ off
ter the war. I don’t know who them Dutch air&mdash;fer’s
I know thar hain’t no Dutch in these mountings noways&mdash;but
if we’ve got to lick ‘em, I reckon we’d just
as well be about it. Damn ‘em anyways, whoever they
air!” With which candid comment she hobbled on
out the door, and never gave a parting glance as she
faced up the street and started for her cabin home.</p>

<p>Granny Williams looked through the window after
her departing guest. “Ho hum!” said she. “Thar
goes the last of the Joslins&mdash;of the real Joslins. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
was the fightin’est one of ‘em all, but she allus was a
good Christian womern.”</p>

<p>“Why hain’t Davy come down here no more lately,
Ma’am?” she asked suddenly of her silent guest.</p>

<p>“I don’t know in the least,” replied Marcia Haddon.
“Does it matter?” Then, relenting: “I wish he
would come! I ought to see him before he goes away,
or before I go.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Granny Williams directly.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to be going. I’m a widow, you see, now,
Granny&mdash;I’m alone! I’ve been thinking a good deal.”</p>

<p>“What ye been thinkin’, child?”</p>

<p>Marcia Haddon, with a strange humility, laid one of
her soft white hands upon the wrinkled one reposing
in the old dame’s lap. “I’ll tell you&mdash;I’ve been thinking
about that little child we met up there in the cave.”</p>

<p>The old woman nodded.</p>

<p>“What will that child and all the others do if the
school stops?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Davy’ll come back,” said Granny Williams&mdash;“he’s
got to come back.”</p>

<p>“If we had buildings, and teachers, and everything,”
mused her guest, “we could take care of any number.”</p>

<p>“Hit’d be a powerful fine thing for everybody,”
said Granny Williams after a time of silence. “Now,
Davy&mdash;he’s so <i>odd</i>, Ma’am. I’ve seen Davy Joslin
set like he was in a dream. If only men wasn’t so
cantankerous!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE EDUCATION OF DAVID JOSLIN</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE hours dragged leaden for the women,
cooped up, silent, as in the old block-house
days, but for the men the great adventure of
going out to war, born in their ancient Highland blood,
sped the time rapidly enough. It cost a certain resolution
on the part of David Joslin to call upon the
“furrin woman,” but now he must say good-by.
Therefore in time he knocked at the door of Granny
Williams’ log house.</p>

<p>Marcia Haddon herself met him, as though she had
sent for him. “Come,” said she. But she led him
not into the house itself.</p>

<p>He walked at her side, silent, as she directed her
footsteps toward the little steps cut into the foot of
the hill. They sat here, both looking out now across
the valley to the hills beyond.</p>

<p>The woman’s gray eyes were wistful and sad. The
eyes of the man, resting everywhere but upon her face,
were also sad. He did not turn to look at her at all&mdash;apparently
did not note the increasing goodliness of
her figure and her rounder contours, the browner coloring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
of her cheek. She was a very comely woman,
Marcia Haddon, young, but wiser than she once had
been&mdash;more impulsive also, less cold, less reserved. It
was as though she entered a new stage of womanhood,
as yet denied her in her chill years of self-repression.
Never until now had she really known the awakening
of woman. Virginal, warming, fluttering, she was not
married woman or widow now; she was a girl, a girl
at the brink of life. Oh! how vast and sweet the
revealing Plan seemed now to her.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re going out,” said she at last, the first
to break the silence.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m going out.” His voice was low and deep.
It seemed to her that she now for the first time realized
its even vibrancy.</p>

<p>At last: “What will become of the work here?” she
began.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell as to that, Mrs. Haddon,” said he. “It
must wait.” She made no reply, and he went on:</p>

<p>“You see, all my life has been pretty much the same
thing. I’ve always had to look ahead and did not dare
look at things between. Once this school up here on
the hill was all I looked at&mdash;and there wasn’t anything
between. There’s other work afoot that’s even
bigger, now. Maybe after that I’ll be fit for this.”</p>

<p>“You’ve done wonderfully well. It’s scarce less
than a miracle&mdash;how you’ve got on.”</p>

<p>“At least I’ve told you all about myself,” said he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
after a time. “I’ve nothing more to say&mdash;now or at
any other time.”</p>

<p>“You need say nothing,” she rejoined. “Life goes
hard for all of us sometimes.” She was conscious of
her banality, but found herself, as so often, dumb in
her largest emotions.</p>

<p>“It was a hard enough start,” he assented. “It’s
hard enough for all of us in here. I’m not so old.”</p>

<p>“No. You only seem old to me. I suppose that’s
because you have had to do so much in so short a time.
But I’m older, too. It’s a sad country&mdash;did you ever
stop to think how few people smile, down here in these
mountains?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know; and you know, now. Well, I suppose
you’ll go away and forget us. We’ve been forgotten,
more than a hundred years. That’s hard&mdash;to
be forgotten.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that of me?” she said, still staring
straight down the valley.</p>

<p>“I hardly know what to think of you,” said he, deliberately.
“You are not like any woman I ever
knew.” He flushed, suddenly remembering he had told
her he never had known but three women in his life.</p>

<p>“Well, be fair, at least. Be sure you know my
point of view. This work ought not to stop.” She
was trying to look at him from the corner of her eye.</p>

<p>“The Lord has built that building up on the hill,
Mrs. Haddon,” answered David Joslin. “I suppose the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Lord will continue it or destroy it. Blessed be the
name of the Lord.”</p>

<p>She half turned her face toward him now as she
replied.</p>

<p>“I’ve told you I’ve been a useless woman all my
life. Well, just the other day I saw a child&mdash;a little
child, out in the hills&mdash;it lived wild, in a cave. I held,
its hand right in mine, this way&mdash;don’t you see? And
then, I thought, there were hundreds of them&mdash;hundreds,
all through these hills.” She was flushing.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he; “many hundreds.”</p>

<p>“Then I thought of the money that’s mine that
maybe oughtn’t all to be mine. You see, I’ve counsel&mdash;lawyers&mdash;that
sort of thing&mdash;men who would help
me in anything I asked. Suppose we had some more
buildings, and plenty of teachers after a time?”</p>

<p>He did not make any answer at all, and she was
obliged to go on unaided.</p>

<p>“In this awful time of the world, Mr. Joslin,” said
she, “everyone ought to be useful. We’ll need more
good citizens in America. All of us women ought to
work in some way. The country must go on, until
we’ve won. Where could I be more useful than here?
Don’t you think I could keep the work going some
way until&mdash;until you came back, David Joslin?”</p>

<p>Still he did not answer, and still she went on,
struggling somewhat desperately with his native reticence
and her own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, they say this is a war for democracy, don’t
you know? And where could we fight better for
democracy? Wasn’t that your ambition&mdash;wasn’t that
your dream?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” suddenly he exclaimed, hoarsely. “That
was my dream! You know how it ended&mdash;you know
why. I killed my own school, you know how.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;you’ve spoken very freely. It’s just as well.
These are days when there’s no time to be lost. And
I’d like you to know, at least how much I’ve marveled
at what you’ve done.”</p>

<p>“Marveled!” said he. “It’s I who have marveled.
But what you say&mdash;if you could keep the school going&mdash;why,
<i>that’s</i> a miracle!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Marcia Haddon quietly, “you’ve always
spoken of miracles as matter of course.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we’d better not talk much more,” said he
after a time, long silences seeming natural now. “I
told you I wasn’t through. I’ve sinned, and I’ll repent.
I’m ignorant&mdash;but I’m going out now to get the
rest of my education. If I am spared ... some time ... I’ve
told you about the other woman up there,”
he finished, anguished. “As you know&mdash;she’s dead.”</p>

<p>“Is she dead forever, David Joslin?” asked Marcia
Haddon quietly. The color in her own cheek was
warm.</p>

<p>“Yes, forever. And I’ll not speak any ill of her
memory.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nor I of the memory of the man that’s dead,”
said she slowly. “It’s life, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s life! And I want it&mdash;<i>all</i>, every bit of
it, all that any man ever coveted or had&mdash;<i>all</i> of a man’s
dues in life. Yes, I want it&mdash;<i>all</i>!”</p>

<p>He spoke now with a sudden fierceness, his gray
eyes aflame in a way she had not seen, that indomitableness
of the inner man now showing through
as never yet she had seen him, so that she felt a thrill,
a shock, as of some vast, measureless dynamo of
power suddenly awaking. “All life is the same thing.
It’s <i>all</i> an education, <i>all</i> a growing&mdash;God! Give me
my chance to grow! Let me get ready, so I can
deserve. I’ve been <i>hungry</i> all my life&mdash;hungry for the
world&mdash;hungry for my education&mdash;hungry for all a
man’s life&mdash;love, happiness, content, power, usefulness.
I’m hungry for this war, even, because I know
it will teach me something or leave me at last at peace.
I’ve not known peace. I’ve lived in torment&mdash;I’m in
torment now. But I’ll come back bigger and better
if I ever come back at all. Life&mdash;why, life&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He halted, his drawn brows turned away.</p>

<p>“That little child that came up to me,” began Marcia
Haddon hastily, as though irrelevantly&mdash;“if I could
do something in the meantime&mdash;while you were out
there&mdash;why, I’d be the happiest woman in all the
world. Yes, I! And I’d said good-by to happiness,
the same as you.” Her eyes were soft now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>“If I thought that could be,” he answered slowly,
“I’d know the end even of this war&mdash;I’d know the
end of my own fight&mdash;I’d know that justice and good
<i>do</i> triumph over all and through all. Oh, what a
dream! And for my people&mdash;the forgotten, the
mocked, the helpless ones. If I&mdash;if <i>you</i> and I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’m going now,” he concluded, long later. “These
are things in which I can’t give you counsel. You’re
the one real woman I ever knew in all my narrow
life&mdash;the one real woman. I reckon I’ve seen them all
now. I wanted to tell you that, before I went away&mdash;I
<i>had</i> to tell you! If only I had lived so that you
wouldn’t think so ill of me. Oh, my God! Always
I do the evil thing when I would do the right I’m so
impatient. It’s so hard for me to be patient now.”</p>

<p>He rose and stood facing straight ahead. The twilight
now was falling softly upon the hills. Sounds
came from the street below&mdash;sounds unwelcome.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” said he, suddenly. “I’ll love you all my
life!”</p>

<p>“Going?” Her voice seemed not yet to accept it
after all. She half raised a hand. The blood of her
cheek surged back.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;to finish my education!”</p>

<p>He stalked away, never looking back.</p>

<p>She sat alone now, still gazing out across the hills,
at a new and wider world than any she had ever
known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>The sounds on the street below became more audible,
wafted by a change in the evening air. She knew
that there was forming yonder a procession of men
who presently would pass out around the shoulder of
the hill at the end of the street. And then at last she
heard fully the throb of the drum, the keening of the
fife. The men of the Cumberlands were marching out
into the world. He was at their head&mdash;going out for
his ordeal, going out to grow, to get ready&mdash;to deserve,
as he had said. What a man he would be&mdash;what a
man he was!</p>

<p>Marcia Haddon suddenly reached out her arms, her
gesture following the marching men, as though something
of her own had gone out with them. She sat,
until she knew not whether she heard the throb of a
passing drum or felt the pulse of a new heart, beating
high and strong. Her Work lay at hand&mdash;out there,
on the hills where the gaunt buildings grew. And on
ahead&mdash;was it Life, as sweet as it was earnest and
compelling, that rested yonder&mdash;on the heights ahead?</p>
